Australia has substantial gas resources. Gas is Australia’s third largest non-renewable energy resource after coal and uranium. 

Conventional gas resources from the North-West shelf, and coal seam gas from Queensland as well as conventional gas from the Cooper Basin, are being developed for LNG export.

Domestic gas supply also comes from those basins (in competition against export prices), as well as from the central NT and Otway and Gippsland basins.

The startup of LNG export from eastern Australia occurred in 2015, at the same time that world petroleum prices declined.

It is likely that Australia possesses significant shale gas and tight gas resources, but these are poorly quantified because exploration for these commodities within Australia has only recently commenced. 

Australia’s gas resources have grown recently as a result of successful exploration programs and are large enough to support expected domestic and export market growth. 
Gas is expected to increase its share of Australia’s energy production and exports over the next few decades. 

Australia is a small producer and exporter of gas, and has a small overall share of world gas resources.

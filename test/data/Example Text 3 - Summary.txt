Basin-Centred Gas is a relatively new gas play being explored in Cooper and other onshore basins.
Definition of shale gas resources is most advanced in the Cooper Basin, where Beach Energy reported the first contingent shale gas resources (2200 PJ, 2 tcf) in 2011; and in 2012 Santos booked the first shale gas reserves (2P ~3 PJ, 3 bcf) on the results of production from the Moomba 191 well. In contrast, there are very large estimates of potentially recoverable shale gas resources of about 480 700 PJ (437 tcf) reported by the EIA (2013) based on the assessment of six basins; and a value in excess of 1 100 000 PJ (1000 tcf) documented by Cook et al. (2013) that aggregates the estimates from 16 basins.

Development of Australia’s shale gas resources face several hurdles, including the need to develop an understanding of the nature of the resources in order to facilitate efficient exploration, supply chain limitations, location relative to market, and competition for capital investment as a high resource risk relative to other resources limits investment. Hence, although the shale gas resource is enormous, its commerciality remains unknown.

Despite more than five years exploration in several countries worldwide, the United States remains the world’s only large-scale producer of shale gas, producing approximately 3700 PJ (3.4 tcf) in 2009 (EIA 2012).

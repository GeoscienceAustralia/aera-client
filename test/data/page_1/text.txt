Most (around 92 per cent) of Australia’s conventional gas resources are located in the Carnarvon, Browse and Bonaparte basins off the north-west coast.

There are also resources in south-west, south-east and central Australia. Large CSG resources exist in the coal basins of Queensland and New South Wales, with further potential resources in South Australia. Known tight gas accumulations are located onshore in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria, while contingent and potential shale gas resources are located in Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. 

Conventional and coal seam gas reserves and resources in Australia are well-constrained, whereas significant uncertainty exists around shale and coal seam gas prospective resources. However, these prospective resources potentially are enormous.

Tight Gas is rarely reported separately to conventional gas, so here is reported as conventional.

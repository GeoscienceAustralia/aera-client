We harness it to light our homes, transport us across the country and around the world, power our industries and produce our food.</p><p >In Australia, we are fortunate to possess plentiful and diverse energy resources, providing security for our own domestic consumption and creating investment and job opportunities to support a growing export market. Coal, oil, gas and uranium make up more than 20 per cent of the value of Australia’s total exports, and are projected to earn around $90 billion a year over the next five years.</p><p >The 2018 edition of the <i>Australian Energy Resources Assessment</i> (AERA) is the latest update in a series of national assessments of Australia&#39;s energy resources, first released in 2010. AERA has been developed by<a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><u><a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoscience Australia</a></u> in collaboration with the<a href=\"http://www.energy.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><u><a href=\"http://www.energy.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of the Environment and Energy</a></u> and support of the<a href=\"http://www.arena.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><u><a href=\"http://www.arena.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Renewable Energy Agency</a></u>, and provides a snapshot of Australia’s energy resources and the demand for them in both domestic and international energy markets.</p><p >AERA shows that Australia has substantial energy resources, and that we are a world leader in exporting these commodities. Australia is largely under-explored for oil and gas, and there is great potential for more to be found. The Australian Government remains committed to continuing oil and gas resource exploration and development to ensure plentiful, reliable energy supply for generations to come. This is achieved through measures including the<a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/eftf\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><u><a href=\"http://www.ga.gov.au/eftf\" target=\"_blank\">Exploring for the Future Program</a></u> and the<a href=\"https://industry.gov.au/resource/Programs/Pages/Gas-Acceleration-Program.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><u><a href=\"https://industry.gov.au/resource/Programs/Pages/Gas-Acceleration-Program.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Gas Acceleration Program</a></u>.</p><p >Australia also has abundant and widely-distributed renewable energy resources. Reflecting Australian Government policies such as the Renewable Energy Target, the use of renewable energy rose to around 16 per cent of Australia’s electricity generation in 2016. The use of hydro energy is well established, and wind and solar energy are becoming increasingly important to our energy mix. Other renewable energy resources such as geothermal, ocean and bio resources show great potential but remain largely undeveloped.</p><p >AERA provides the data that industry and policy makers need to compare energy commodities and understand their value on the domestic and world markets. This evidence base is essential for making informed decisions on resource and energy policies that affect the Australian people, economy and environment, and for ensuring the Australian Government is responsive to energy market changes. The Australian Government is powering forward with the National Energy Guarantee, a plan for a better energy future for Australia that will deliver an affordable and reliable energy system that will also help meet our international commitments..</p><p >The 2018 update of AERA has been developed as a website, making it easier to navigate and enabling digital delivery of the underpinning datasets. This gives users the unprecedented ability to compare and integrate the data with other sources in innovative ways.</p><p >AERA provides valuable information to ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of reliable energy resource use, exploration, production and export into the future.</p><p ><img alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

A secure supply of affordable, reliable and environmentally sustainable energy is essential to Australia’s future economic growth and prosperity. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has an abundance and diversity of energy resources that supports domestic consumption and substantial fossil fuel energy exports around the world. Australia continues to have the world’s largest known economic uranium resources, the fourth largest coal (black and brown) resources and substantial conventional and unconventional gas resources (<u><a href=\"#kix.rluefqcvmi5c\" >Table 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#kix.2n9ulk6jrl30\" >Figure 1</a></u>). There is good potential for further growth of the non-renewable resource base through new discoveries.

Hydro energy resources have been extensively developed, and wind, solar and bioenergy resources are increasingly being exploited for electricity generation. Although adoption of offset technologies (e.g. geothermal heat pumps, solar hot water) has gradually increased, the other renewable energy resources remain largely untapped for electricity generation (<u><a href=\"#id.dgn7ao8syuig\" >Table 2</a></u>). The utilisation of renewable energy will continue to increase significantly to around 2020, reflecting government policies (e.g. the Renewable Energy Target) and falling installation costs. Advances in renewable energy generation and storage technologies and better mapping of resource potential will be important for continued uptake, and so will technologies and policies for grid integration.</p><p >Domestic and international demand for Australia’s energy resources continues to rise, although the energy mix is changing. However, the energy intensity of the Australian economy is expected to continue to fall over the next few decades through energy efficiency gains and a changing industrial landscape. Increasing use of renewable energy sources will require energy infrastructure to become more flexible and potentially decentralised over time. As this transition occurs, understanding Australia’s energy resources and the factors likely to affect their development has never been more important.</p><p >Geoscience Australia and the Economics Branch of the Department of the Environment and Energy, with support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, have produced this integrated scientific and economic assessment of Australia’s non-renewable and renewable energy resources. This publication provides a snapshot in time to enable a comparison across energy resources. This release of the Australian Energy Resource Assessment (AERA) is the first to be published in an internet-delivered format. This new format offers enhanced functionality (including data download) and easier navigation.

These resources are expected to last for many more decades, even as production increases. Australia has a significant proportion of the world’s uranium and coal resources, and large resources of conventional and unconventional gas. Australia has access to a range of high-quality renewable energy sources, many of which are yet to be developed. Australia also has significant potential to improve its energy productivity, using its abundant resources more efficiently to power its boost economic growth. </p><h3 >Assessment methods and uncertainty</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In considering the available quantity of energy resources, it is necessary to consider the possible resource base, the known resource base and energy conversion technologies.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The resource base is the entirety of the physical resource. However, it cannot be considered in isolation from energy conversion technologies. Thorium is an example – thorium could be a high-energy nuclear fuel, but technologies are not yet available for its use. Solar energy provides another example – sun drying of fruits is an ancient application of solar energy, and it is only in the past decade that solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has become readily accessible. The hydraulic fracturing technology developed in the past 20 years that has allowed the use of unconventional oil and gas from previously non-viable shale reservoirs is another example.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In general terms, non-renewable energy resources are measured by volume or mass, whereas renewable energy resources are measured by energy flux. Estimating the resource base requires setting a cutoff grade – for example, a minimum concentration and volume of gas in a reservoir, or a minimum annual solar irradiance. An energy conversion technology is implicit in this; hence, the minimum viable resource is determined not only by the inherent nature of the resource, but also by the technology available to harness it. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The known resource base refers to a potential resource for which measurements have been made to quantify the grade or quality and extent of the resource – for example, a well drilled into an oil reservoir to provide a sample, or the measurement of wind speed, direction and prevalence over an extended period. The process of ‘proving’ that a resource is suitable for development is one of reducing uncertainty through the measurement of the nature of the resource, and its commercial and social viability. ‘Prospective’ or ’undiscovered’ are the terms often given to those resources with high uncertainty around their existence and viability. ‘Contingent resources’ or ‘measured resources’ are the terms often given to resources that have been confirmed to exist but are not yet known to be viable. ‘Reserve’ is the term given to resources that are known to exist in sufficient quantity and grade that commercial and social viability is confirmed. The Resource Classification appendix provides information on the various resource classification schemes that are applied to describing the commerciality of energy resources.</p><h3 >Australia’s energy resource base</h3><h4 >Non-renewables</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s non-renewable energy resources include fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil) and nuclear energy fuels (uranium and potentially thorium). <u><a href=\"#id.2e4o68mmbl4i\" >Table 1</a></u> provides a summary of current resource estimates, and <u><a href=\"#id.ufxew1vlm7qc\" >Figure 1</a></u> shows their distribution. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s conventional liquid hydrocarbon resources include crude oil, and the condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) resources associated with gas accumulations. As at December 2014 crude oil Economic Demonstrated Resources (EDR) are estimated to be 3286 petajoules (PJ) or 559 million barrels (mmbbl). Australia’s crude oil resources are small by world standards and are being depleted at a faster rate than they are being replenished by discovery. As a result, Australia’s domestic oil production is declining, and Australia is increasingly reliant on imports to meet its requirements. However, the oil potential of Australia’s frontier basins has not yet been adequately assessed, and further exploration may yield additional resources. Australia has more substantial liquid hydrocarbon resources as condensate (EDR of 7421 PJ; 1262 mmbbl) and LPG resources (2633 PJ; 625 mmbbl). However, access to these resources is dependent on the development of the associated gas resources. Australia has significant prospective oil shale resources, which could provide additional liquid fuels if developed.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has substantial conventional gas resources that are located mostly off the north-west coast of Western Australia, and significant unconventional resources onshore. Conventional gas EDR are estimated to be 77 253 PJ (70 trillion cubic feet [tcf]) as at December 2014. Demonstrated resources are expected to grow with further exploration, even as production increases. Coal seam gas (CSG) resources are located primarily in east-coast basins, and EDR have grown substantially in recent years. In December 2015, CSG EDR were estimated at 45 895 PJ (43 tcf). Prospective shale and tight gas resources are held in low-permeability reservoirs in basins across Australia, but EDR are located primarily in the Cooper and Perth basins. Shale gas and tight gas EDR in December 2015 were 0 PJ and 39 PJ (0 tcf and 0.03 tcf) respectively. The higher production cost of shale and tight gas resources means that the EDR for these resources change much more rapidly in response to changing market conditions than do conventional gas EDR.</p><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\"  id=\"id.2e4o68mmbl4i\"><p >Table 1 Australian non-renewable energy resources</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Resource</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Unit</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Economic Demonstrated Resources</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total Demonstrated Resources<sup>a</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Crude oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ </p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">3286<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">7066<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Condensate</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">7421<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">16 463<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">LPG</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2633<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">5957<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Shale oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Oil shale</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Conventional gas</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">77 253<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">186 235<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coal seam gas</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">45 895<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">79 450<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Tight gas</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">39<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1748<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Shale gas</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">12 252<sup>c</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Black coal<sup>d</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1 916 697</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1 999 669</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Brown coal<sup>d</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">754 855</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">3 250 352</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Uranium<sup>e</sup> </p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">711 076</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">718 083</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Thorium</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">kt<sup>f</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">130</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total resources<sup>g</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">3 519 155</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">6 277 275</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\" ><p >a.

Different renewable energy resources have different levels of availability and predictability; hence, these resources are not readily classifiable or comparable to non-renewable resources. Estimates of potential renewable resources can be made based on maps that show the energy – potentially or theoretically – available at a site (<u><a href=\"#id.2h6bmgvtpppb\" >Figure 2</a></u>), in conjunction with detailed studies of the annual and diurnal variation in the energy, to determine the capacity factor. This is the average actual energy output compared with the theoretical maximum possible output if the energy were continuously and fully available for use.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Renewable resources can also be reported in terms of installed capacity. Broadly speaking, this is a measure of how much of the resource is currently able to be used, or the maximum power output of the currently installed generators.

There are also lower temperature geothermal resources in a number of sedimentary basins that are potentially suitable for electricity generation or direct-use applications. Approximately 440 570 PJ of potentially viable deep geothermal resources were identified in the decade to 2013, but due to technical challenges, lack of capital investment and reduced electricity demand, these estimates are no longer considered current. While Birdsville is currently the only geothermal plant generating electricity, new low-temperature geothermal power plants are being built to supply small towns in outback Queensland, including Quilpie, Thargomindah, Normanton and Longreach. The Winton geothermal power plant is due to be operational in June 2018. Ground source heat pumps are being chosen by large-scale residential property developers as an alternative for air-conditioning. As at December 2016, Australia had 40.9 megawatts thermal (MW<sub>th</sub>) of direct-use geothermal capacity that was either installed or in the final stages of commissioning, and an additional 197.4 MW<sub>th</sub> of total geoexchange capacity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">At August 2016, Australia had more than 100 operating hydroelectric power stations, with a total installed capacity of 8018 MW. These are typically located in the areas of highest rainfall and elevation, mostly in New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. Although a dry climate coupled with low runoff over much of Australia limits any substantial expansion of traditional hydro power, pumped hydro for electricity storage is being examined at existing hydro installations and new sites. The Snowy 2.0 project is examining the feasibility of upgrading the pumped hydro capacity of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Future hydroelectricity projects using smaller off-river sites have the potential to provide decentralised, local energy storage. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has some of the best wind resources in the world, which are widely distributed across the continent. Wind energy technology is relatively mature, and its uptake is growing quickly in Australia and is supported by government policies. Australia had a total installed large scale wind generation capacity of 4980 MW in December 2017. Since then, there has been a surge in investment, with almost 2.5 GW of wind large scale generation expected to be under construction during 2018.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The solar resource is a vast potential source of energy. The Australian continent has the highest solar radiation per square metre of any continent in the world. The total installed large-scale (&#62;1 MW) solar electricity generation capacity in Australia is estimated at 310 MW by end of 2017, 7022 MW of small-scale rooftop solar PV capacity (up to 1 MW) had also been installed. Following rapid reductions in solar costs, over 2 GW of solar large scale capacity is expected to be under construction during 2018. At current rates, small-scale solar PV capacity is expected to pass 8 GW during 2018. It is now cheaper to get electricity from the roof  than from the grid for most reasonable payback periods. Another technology for capturing the solar resource is concentrating solar thermal (CST). Concentrating solar thermal is flexible (via cheap integrated thermal storage) and synchronous, although it is currently less mature and more expensive than solar PV. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia also has good opportunities to exploit the ocean energy resource, which includes mechanical energy from the tides and waves, and thermal energy from the sun’s heat (ocean thermal). These resources tend to be more predictable than wind and solar, and complement the seasonal availability of solar, in particular. The best tidal energy resources are located along the northern margin of the continent, especially the north-west coast of Western Australia, and are largely removed from the major energy demand centres. Australia also has a world-class wave energy resource along its western and southern coastlines. The approximately 1 MW of ocean energy generation capacity currently installed is provided by a patchwork of wave and tidal stream pilot generation projects. Most ocean energy technologies are relatively new, and still need to be proven in pilot and demonstration plants. Currently, these technologies are significantly more expensive than other, more mature, forms of variable renewable energy – namely solar PV and wind.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Bioenergy also has significant potential as an energy resource in Australia. Biomass can be used to generate electricity and heat, as well as liquid fuels for transport. Currently, biomass for electricity generation in Australia is primarily from bagasse (sugarcane residue), wood waste, and gas from landfill and sewage facilities. As at November 2015, 812 MW of bioenergy generation capacity was installed, approximately 60 per cent of which was from bagasse. Commercialisation of advanced bioenergy technologies is likely to increase the range of resources, such as the non-edible (woody) parts of plants and, potentially, algae. These can be used to produce biofuels and heat, and generate electricity.</p><h4 >Modes of energy storage</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Wind turbines, solar PV and ocean energy technologies are unique in that they generate electricity directly coupled to the intensity of the resource; they are therefore variable and non-dispatchable resources. In contrast, every other energy resource has an inherent degree of storage, as listed in <u><a href=\"#id.rc8g9j8blg4a\" >Table 3</a></u>.</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\"  id=\"id.rc8g9j8blg4a\"><p >Table 3 Storage capability of energy resources</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Energy resource</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Use</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Storage mechanism</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Transport fuel, electricity generation</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Accumulated in the Earth (fossil fuel); stored in supply chain once extracted</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Gas</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Domestic and industrial heating, manufacturing, electricity generation</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Accumulated in the Earth (fossil fuel); stored in supply chain once extracted; underground storage facility for processed gas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coal</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation, steel and cement making</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Accumulated in the Earth (fossil fuel); stored in supply chain once extracted; stockpiled at electricity generation plants</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Uranium, thorium</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Accumulated in the Earth (non-renewable); stored in supply chain once extracted; stockpiled at electricity generation plants</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geothermal</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation, direct use of heat</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Heat accumulated in the Earth and extracted as required, or the Earth used as heat sink</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Hydro</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Dams provide storage.

Historically, the uptake of any new energy resource has depended on the development of a reliable, cost-effective supply chain. The supply chain for the energy storage technologies (e.g. batteries, pumped hydro) that will facilitate grid stability in the future is now being developed in Australia.</p><h3 >Ownership and administration of energy resources</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Under the Australian Constitution, mineral and petroleum resources are owned either by the Australian Government, or the state and territory governments. Exploration and development of these resources are undertaken by companies operating under licences and permits granted by government. The Australian, state and territory governments actively encourage investment in Australia’s energy resources. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Petroleum exploration and recovery activities beyond three nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline and within Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (‘Commonwealth Waters’) are the responsibility of the Australian Government. These resources are governed under the <i><a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00051\" target=\"_blank\">Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006</a></i> and by maritime boundary treaties with neighbouring countries. The Joint Authorities, the <a href=\"http://www.nopta.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nopsema.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority</a> grant and administer petroleum titles, and ensure that exploration and development activities are compliant with the relevant regulations. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Exploration for, and development of, non-renewable resources onshore and out to three nautical miles are the responsibility of the state and territory governments, and are administered under the relevant state or territory legislation relating to minerals and petroleum. The legislation varies between jurisdictions, but is similar in content and administration, and is based on a two-stage process of exploration permit and production licence. More information is provided in <i><a href=\"https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/110628/110628_investors_guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Mineral and petroleum in Australia: a guide for investors</a></i>, and from the state and territory mineral and petroleum departments and agencies.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Development of renewable resources is similarly governed by state and territory planning and development legislation, and is administered by the relevant departments and agencies.</p><h2 >Australia’s energy market</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The energy sector is an important part of the Australian economy. Australia’s energy production and exports have grown strongly during the past 30 years, especially in recent years in response to strong global demand for energy. Australia’s energy sector supports a range of manufacturing industries, and provides employment and significant infrastructure development in remote and regional areas. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">This section examines the key factors that affect energy markets in Australia, and provides an overview of current Australian energy production, consumption and trade. </p><h3 >Energy production and distribution infrastructure</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia currently has good-quality energy supply chain infrastructure, including electricity generation and transmission, port, rail, and gas pipelines and processing facilities. Any expansion of Australia’s energy market, including access to new energy resources, will require investment in energy infrastructure, particularly electricity generation and transmission. Additional investment will be required to replace ageing energy assets, and to integrate variable and non-variable renewable energy sources into existing energy supply chains.</p><h4 >Electricity</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has five main electricity systems and numerous standalone, remote electricity systems. The largest of the systems is the National Energy Market (NEM) in eastern Australia; this is followed by the south-west and north-west interconnected systems (SWIS and NWIS) in Western Australia, and the Darwin–Katherine and Alice Springs systems in the Northern Territory (<u><a href=\"#id.9v31cxg80nup\" >Figure 4</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.9v31cxg80nup\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

The NEM is the world’s longest interconnected electricity system, covering approximately 5000 km extending from Port Douglas in Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia, and across to Tasmania via the Basslink interconnector (Australian Energy Regulator 2017). This market is the foundation of Australia’s electricity infrastructure, including transmission lines and generators. The NEM is linked by six major transmission interconnectors. The NEM transmission and distribution network consists of more than 43 000 km of overhead transmission and distribution lines, and more than 767 000 km of underground cables. A number of projects are under construction, and feasibility studies are in progress to expand the interconnector system – for example, the TasNetworks study, supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is examining the feasibility of building a second Basslink interconnector. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The various assets that comprise Australia’s electricity infrastructure are owned and operated by the state and territory governments or by the private sector. Wholesale markets have been established for the dispatch and trade of electricity in the NEM and the SWIS. Electricity exchange between producers and consumers is facilitated by a pool in which the output from all generators is aggregated and scheduled to meet demand by information technology systems. These systems balance supply with demand, maintain reserve requirements, select which components of the system operate at any one time, determine the spot price and facilitate the financial settlement of the market (Australian Energy Market Operator 2017a). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The grid connects, and is relatively centralised around, power stations at the fuel sources, especially the major coal resources and gas supply infrastructure, and the main electricity demand centres. As electricity generation from other resources (including wind and CSG) has commenced, new nodes have been added. Development of additional sources of electricity, particularly renewables, will require further expansion of the grid, especially in areas not previously connected. Development will also be required to increase the flexibility to manage the incorporation of semi-scheduled or non-scheduled generation (predominantly from wind and solar), combined with increasingly decentralised generation (from solar PV). The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts approximately $50 billion being invested in further developing the NEM during the next 25 years (Australian Energy Market Operator 2012). </p><h4 >Ports</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has approximately 45 trading ports, a number of which are equipped to export coal, oil, gas and uranium. There are seven major coal-exporting ports, most of which are in New South Wales and Queensland. There are also 27 ports that export petroleum liquids, five that ship gas and two that ship uranium (<u><a href=\"#id.4dpsxwzhoqha\" >Figure 5</a></u>; Ports Australia 2015). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Infrastructure capacity constraints (including port and rail) have limited the ability of the Australian coal industry to respond to growing global demand during the past few years. However, recent additions to capacity, including an expansion of the Hay Point coal port, should help alleviate these constraints (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2016a). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.4dpsxwzhoqha\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

In New South Wales and Queensland, rail is used to transport coal from mines to loading ports. Rail is also used to transport uranium to Adelaide and Darwin, the only ports open for uranium exports. A recent addition to Australia’s rail infrastructure is the Wiggins Island rail project in Queensland (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2016a).</p><h4 >Oil and gas infrastructure</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Gas pipelines in Australia deliver gas from where it is extracted or processed to where it is consumed or exported (<u><a href=\"#id.4dpsxwzhoqha\" >Figure 5</a></u>). Australia currently has more than 20 000 km of high-pressure gas transmission pipelines. The length of Australia’s low-pressure local gas distribution network is more than 75 000 km. This network serves more than 4 043 000 customers (Australian Energy Regulator 2017).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Major pipelines connect the gas resources of the Cooper Basin, and offshore Gippsland and Otway basins to the major population and industrial centres on the eastern seaboard (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide), as well as Mount Isa, Queensland. The CSG production from the Bowen and Surat basins also feeds into this network. The gas resources off the north-west coast of Western Australia are distributed to the mining and urban centres of Western Australia via the Dampier–Bunbury, Pilbara and Esperance pipelines. Another pipeline system transports gas from the onshore Amadeus and offshore Bonaparte basins to service the northern gas market. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Construction of the 622 km Northern Gas Pipeline linking Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory to Mount Isa in Queensland commenced in July 2017. When complete in late 2018, it will provide the first link between the northern and eastern gas markets (Jemena 2017). Other major pipeline infrastructure projects in 2017 include the New South Wales – Victoria interconnect; Moomba–Sydney and Eastern Gas pipeline capacity improvements; and the interconnection of the Southeast Australia and Moomba–Adelaide pipelines, and the Moomba–Sydney and Eastern Gas pipelines (Australian Energy Regulator 2017). Demand for further gas pipeline infrastructure is likely to increase as gas-fired peaking plants play an increasingly significant role in stand-by electricity generation in support of expanded electricity production from renewables such as wind.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There are approximately 48 operational gas processing plants in Australia. Of these, 16 are CSG plants, 23 are natural gas plants and nine are liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants. The three Queensland LNG export processing plants (Queensland Curtis LNG, Gladstone LNG and Australia Pacific LNG) became operational between January 2015 and December 2016. Four established LNG projects (Gorgon, Northwest Shelf, Pluto and Darwin) are operational in Western Australia, and three additional offshore LNG developments (Wheatstone, Ichthys and Prelude) are currently under construction.</p><h3 >Energy market drivers</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The energy market is embedded in a broad suite of macro environmental drivers (<u><a href=\"#id.n722cjamjz2w\" >Figure 6</a></u>), which influence and shape the energy market, and determine both the quantity and types of energy consumed in Australia. The seven drivers of energy market demand are discussed below.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.n722cjamjz2w\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Given Australia’s prominent role in the global energy market, these global drivers also affect investment and production decisions relating to non-renewable fuels in Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s energy prices are affected by direct and indirect influences on domestic and world supply and demand for energy commodities. For example, climatic events may increase the demand for heating and result in increased world oil prices. Geopolitical factors that could potentially reduce world supply of oil, such as tensions in the Middle East, generally result in increases in the world oil price. Conversely, events such as the global financial crisis, which reduce the demand for oil as economic activity declines, result in oil prices falling. The ‘shale revolution’, producing a much-elevated supply of unconventional oil and gas in the United States, has created a potentially significant constraint for global oil and gas prices in the medium term.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Real energy prices have, except for a dip in mid-2008 as a result of the global economic downturn, risen steadily during the past decade following a period of low prices, which discouraged investment in new energy supplies. The rise in prices reflects strong growth in demand for energy, particularly in China, with suppliers struggling to bring additional production online to meet demand. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the medium term, it is expected that strengthened global demand, underpinned by a positive outlook for world economic growth, will place upward pressure on energy prices, although significant volatility is expected to remain. A more detailed assessment of the medium-term outlook for energy commodities is provided in the <i>Resources and Energy Quarterly</i> (Department of Industry Innovation and Science 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the longer term, energy price trends will depend on a number of factors, including global demand and constraints on supply (notably the level of investment in additional production capacity), costs of production and technology. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Oil prices provide a useful example. Key factors that are expected to drive long-term oil prices are the cost of developing remaining oil reserves, the level and timing of investment in production and refining capacity, technological development in relation to alternative liquid fuels and the growing commercialisation of electric vehicles. Although the marginal cost of production is expected to rise over time, technological developments associated with non-conventional liquids, such as coal-to-liquids, gas-to-liquids, shale oil and second-generation biofuels, could play a major role in moderating the rise in oil prices. </p><h4 >Economic environment</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Until recently, growth in the economy has been underpinned by increasing demand for energy. However, the continuing decline in the energy intensity of the Australian economy will significantly offset the effect of future growth on energy demand. Improvements in energy efficiency and the decline of energy-intensive industries are expected to lead to a decline in energy intensity in the future (see Department of Industry and Science 2015, and Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics 2012 for further discussion). Another factor in the economic environment is the changing dynamics of the cost competitiveness of fuels. Retail prices to households have increased significantly during the past ten years, putting pressure on household budgets and encouraging energy conservation (<u><a href=\"#id.bxxrivvrr4p5\" >Figure 7</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.bxxrivvrr4p5\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Increases in population generally result in increases in energy demand. The Australian population is expected to increase from 23.9 million in 2015 to 37.6 million in 2050 (Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics 2014). Nevertheless, energy consumption per capita in Australia has been in decline, falling from 270 gigajoules (GJ) per person in 2008–07 to 249 GJ per person in 2014–15 (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2016b). If this decline continues, together with an increasing preference for clean energy in Australian society, the increase in energy consumption associated with population growth will continue to slow.</p><h4 >Technology</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The uptake of new technologies is a major influence on the Australian energy market. New technologies are sought for emissions reductions and, increasingly, for lowered costs. Renewable energy has mostly been deployed to date in the electricity sector, but its use is expected to become more widespread in other sectors, such as transport (e.g. through electric vehicles) and energy exports, in coming decades.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The integration of new renewable energy, energy storage, distributed generation and demand response technologies into the electricity system requires careful management to ensure that grid stability issues are managed and sustainable supply is achieved, while maintaining prices that are acceptable to consumers and reducing emissions. The use of flexible capacity can help balance supply and demand. The locations of existing large-scale renewable electricity generation facilities in Australia are shown in <u><a href=\"#id.selyw2bhks9h\" >Figure 8</a></u>.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Flexible capacity includes comparatively mature technologies such as pumped hydro and bioenergy, as well as developing technologies such as large-scale batteries, CST and hydrogen. A mix of these technologies would be expected to support transition to an electricity system with a high share of renewable energy, with the addition of management technologies such as interconnection and demand management. Pumped hydroelectricity storage (PHES) is currently the most mature and economically viable form of flexible capacity. Small-scale (domestic) and large-scale (grid, ~100 megawatt hour [MWh]) batteries are also being installed.</p><h4 >Natural/physical environment</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The availability of resources is a key driver of energy use. Australia has abundant reserves of non-renewable fuels, and world-class renewable resources. However, finding, developing and producing these resources require significant investment. The incentives to invest depend on costs of production, prices, technological advances, government policies and the global environment.</p><h4 >Policy and regulatory environment</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Government policies can affect the pace of growth in energy demand and the type of energy used. Policies designed to improve energy efficiency, for instance, will slow the pace of growth in energy demand. Policies designed to increase energy security may encourage diversity in the types of fuels used in an economy, or diversity in where the energy is sourced. Policies to address environmental issues such as climate change may target a greater uptake of renewable energy technologies. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">One government policy currently in place that is reshaping the energy market is the Renewable Energy Target (RET). The RET is designed to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2020. This will be achieved through an expansion of the previous mandatory RET scheme, which began in 2001. The RET operates in two parts: a mandatory Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and a voluntary Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme. The LRET encourages the deployment of large-scale renewable generation by legislating that wholesale electricity purchasers must source and surrender certificates to the Clean Energy Regulator. The RET legislation requires that 33 000 gigawatt hours (GWh) worth of certificates – equivalent to that quantity of renewable generation – be surrendered in 2020. Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme certificates are created by small-scale systems such as solar water heaters, residential solar panels, and small-scale wind and hydro systems. Small-scale generators may voluntarily participate by selling certificates to the Clean Energy Regulator, but there is no legal requirement for them to do so. Small-scale certificates are anticipated to provide more than 4000 GWh of renewable generation by 2020. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Australian Government is also supporting renewables through ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is an independent agency tasked with increasing the supply and improving the competitiveness of renewable energy in Australia. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency makes grants available to reduce financial and technical risk, and focuses on sharing knowledge from funded projects. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s core grant funding is established by the <i><a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00629\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011</a></i><i>,</i> which provides the agency with $2 billion to invest in renewable energy projects until 2022.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The CEFC is a statutory authority established by the Australian Government under the <i><a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00265\" target=\"_blank\">Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012</a></i> to unlock flows of finance to renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies (other than carbon capture and storage [CCS]). The CEFC is credited with $2 billion each financial year, for five years from 1 July 2013, to enable it to invest in the clean energy sector. It provides concessional loans and makes equity investments, and actively works to encourage banks and other financiers to participate in clean energy investment. The CEFC operates the $200 million Clean Energy Innovation Fund (CEIF) in consultation with ARENA. The CEIF targets technologies and businesses that have passed beyond the research and development stage, and can benefit from early seed or growth capital to help them progress to the next stage of development.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Programs aimed at developing CCS, such as the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program, have been reduced in scope. The removal of carbon pricing has removed the possibility of commercialisation for this technology in the near term. Activity is continuing under the CarbonNet initiative and the Gorgon Carbon Dioxide Injection project.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The NEG policy is scheduled to commence in 2020. The NEG is made up of two guarantees that together will require energy retailers and some large users across the NEM to deliver reliable and lower-emissions energy generation each year. A reliability guarantee set by the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator will deliver the correct level of dispatchable energy in each state and territory. An emissions guarantee determined by the Australian Government and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator will be set to contribute to Australia’s international commitments. The NEG is intended to be a market-based solution that will integrate energy and climate policy to deliver a more affordable, more reliable and lower-emissions energy system (Turnbull 2017).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.selyw2bhks9h\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Using new energy resources, particularly renewables, will require investment in a more flexible and decentralised electricity grid, as well as storage (Australian Energy Market Operator 2016a). </p><h3 >Overview of Australian energy production, consumption and trade</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has world-class energy resources and is a major producer of energy. Approximately 79 per cent of Australian energy production was exported in 2014–15. The outlook for Australian energy production from coal, oil, gas and uranium is tied to global trends in demand, supply and prices. Production from renewable resources is not currently tied directly to international energy trade, but this will change if hydrogen becomes a significant fuel or if exporting electricity directly becomes feasible via a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) connection between Australia and Asia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">This section provides an overview of Australia’s energy market, drawn from the latest time-series data published in the Australian Energy Statistics (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2016b). Specifically, this section analyses and discusses long-term historical trends in Australian energy production, primary energy consumption, electricity generation and trade from 1974–75 to 2014–15.</p><h4 >Primary energy production in Australia</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s energy production has increased substantially over the past four decades, growing at an average rate of 4.6 per cent per year to 19 764 PJ in 2014–15 (<u><a href=\"#id.m6tyh5p3wpgg\" >Figure 9</a></u>). Australia’s net energy exports have increased strongly, growing at an average rate of 7.8 per cent during the period. In 2014–15, more than three-quarters (79 per cent) of Australia’s total energy production was exported, consisting largely of coal, natural gas and uranium.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.m6tyh5p3wpgg\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Australia is the world’s largest exporter of metallurgical coal and the second largest exporter of thermal coal. Australia is also the second largest exporter of LNG and is among the largest exporters of uranium.</p><h2 >Energy market outlook in Australia</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">This section introduces the drivers of energy demand in the broader context of the energy environment. It concludes with a brief discussion of the outlook for fossil fuels, renewable energy and electricity generation in Australia, and the major factors affecting this outlook.</p><h3 >Fossil fuels outlook</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is a major global producer and exporter of fossil fuels (thermal and metallurgical coal, natural gas, and oil).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Energy exports are projected to earn approximately $90 billion per year over the next five years, only marginally lower than the value of all other resource commodities combined (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2017). The current international prices for major fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are relatively low compared with recent history, and the outlook is for only moderate growth. The outlook for production volumes differs markedly between fuels. Crude oil production is projected to fall, but there will be an increase in condensate production associated with new LNG production facilities coming online. LNG exports are projected to show a rapid expansion, making Australia one of the world’s largest LNG exporters. Coal production is expected to show little growth in a heavily supplied global market.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the longer term, the outlook is substantially more uncertain. Global demand for coal, oil and gas is strongly linked to the global population and economic growth, particularly in China and India; to technological developments in resource extraction and fuel utilisation; and to competition from new technologies – all of these are uncertain in the long term. Global climate change policies could also have a long-term impact on fuel use in electricity generation and on demand through higher energy efficiency standards.</p><h4 >Fuel prices</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Global fossil fuel prices have shown a dramatic fall since late 2014.The oil price has virtually halved since the highs of the previous five years (<u><a href=\"#id.1pbdyfgpd6jv\" >Figure 23</a></u>). These falls are partly related to the global expansion of fossil fuel production that occurred in response to the previous high prices. High prices before 2015 incentivised greater investment and innovation in production technologies, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation (fracking) in the United States shale oil and gas industries.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">However, with lower prices globally, the incentives for exploration and production have since diminished significantly. Given that we expect only moderate growth in global fuel prices in the medium term, we do not see any quick return to investment. A significant expansion of production above current forecasts is not expected until demand rises and global prices increase.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the Australian context, there has been a significant expansion in the LNG production industry. A similar rapid expansion of LNG production is under way in the United States, and these additions to global capacity are expected to exceed growth in demand, leading to a period of excess supply. This will contribute to lower LNG prices in the medium term, particularly in the spot LNG market, and reduced incentives for new investment.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.1pbdyfgpd6jv\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

High production levels are expected to continue in the medium term, but further expansion will depend on global demand and price conditions. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Oil production is in decline as a result of declining oil reserves and reserve additions not matching the rate of decline. A bright spot is the increase in condensate reserves associated with the LNG developments at Gorgon, Prelude and Ichthys. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Reserve estimates for fossil fuel resources are not simply a function of geological estimation. It takes significant investment to find and prove up reserves, and there is no incentive to prove up reserves for which there is no ready market, or where prices are too low to sustain future production from higher-cost reserves. Under the current outlook, fuel prices are expected to show only moderate growth from the current low level, which implies less exploration expenditure and smaller additions to reserves.</p><h4 >Competition</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Fossil fuels are facing increasing competition from alternative energy sources and technologies. Perhaps the greatest competition for fossil fuels is from solar and wind electricity generation technologies. The costs of these technologies are declining rapidly, and these declines are expected to continue in the future, although there are also costs associated with integrating these technologies into the grid. Electricity generation from fossil fuels could compete in a low carbon world if the costs of CCS and other emissions-reduction technologies can be brought down sufficiently.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There is also increasing competition in end-use applications. For example, in the residential sector, traditional gas heating faces growing competition from highly efficient reverse-cycle air-conditioning and solar hot water systems. In the transport sector, there is significant growth potential for electric vehicles, and research is under way on hydrogen-based fuel cell technologies.</p><h4 >Technology</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The continuing use of fossil fuels will depend on technological progress in both production technologies and efficient energy conversion. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">On the production side, there have been significant improvements in oil and gas production technologies, including advanced deepwater technologies, enhanced recovery, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation. LNG technology is also evolving steadily – for example, larger, more efficient LNG vessels.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Innovation is also progressing on the demand side. Gas equipment has become more efficient, enabling gas to compete with other sources of energy. In the electricity generation sector, coal is being used more efficiently in the new supercritical and ultra-supercritical power plants, which operate at higher temperatures and pressures.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Research is currently under way in technologies for CCS, which lower carbon emissions from electricity generation by gas and coal, and could enable these fuels to compete with low carbon technologies such as solar and wind. However, after several decades of research and development, CCS has not progressed to the levels anticipated, mostly due to market drivers and a lack of identified suitable geological storage sites.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The transport sector is also seeing steady progress in the efficiency of petroleum-fuelled vehicle engines, and new ways of using fossil fuels, such as vehicles fuelled by compressed natural gas and LNG.</p><h3 >Renewables outlook</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although the majority of Australia’s electricity production is currently derived from coal generators, the future pattern of electricity generation is expected to place greater reliance on renewable energy sources. Renewable energy generation increased from 14.6 per cent of Australia’s electricity in 2015 to approximately 16 per cent in 2016 (Department of the Environment and Energy 2017b). This was largely due to increased hydro power station performance from higher rainfall (Clean Energy Council 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Looking forward, the greater emphasis on renewable technologies is already playing out in Australia’s electricity markets, with approximately 900 MW of renewable energy capacity actively under construction at the beginning of 2017 (Clean Energy Council 2017). Recent retirements of coal generators, including Victoria’s Hazelwood and South Australia’s Northern power stations, have removed significant capacity, which has not been replaced (Australian Energy Regulator 2017). These trends are reflected in the 10 678 MW of large-scale wind and 11 043 MW of large-scale solar new NEM connection requests as at 1 July 2017 (Australian Energy Market Operator 2017b). Rooftop solar PV also continues to grow strongly, at a rate of around 1 GW per year.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The ongoing transformation of the Australian electricity system will require continued investment in renewable energy and flexible-capacity technologies (e.g. batteries, pumped hydro and demand response). At the same time, the effectiveness of this investment depends on factors related to the development and use of renewable energy sources.</p><h4 >Impact on cost competitiveness</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Cost competitiveness refers to the relative cost of a generator to produce electricity for the market when consumers want it. A technology is more cost competitive if it can provide electricity to the market at a lower cost than the next best alternative at a time when consumers demand it.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Hydro, solar PV and onshore wind technologies are all highly developed and have been successfully commercialised in many places. For these technologies, cost competitiveness will be driven by economies of scale, incremental technical improvements and reduced financing costs. Research to improve the efficiency of solar PV cells and reduce material costs will also help drive further cost reductions.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Renewable technologies such as deep geothermal, wave energy, offshore wind and concentrated solar thermal are currently not cost competitive because they are in the early stages of development. However, greater expenditure on research, development and deployment (RD&#38;D), and learning from deployment in Australia and internationally are expected to deliver productivity gains for most of these technologies. This will eventually bring the cost of producing electricity from these technologies closer to that of traditional energy electricity sources </p><h4 >Renewable energy, reliability and system security</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Reliability of electricity is defined as the extent to which demand is met by supply. The Australian Energy Market Commission reliability standard requires 99.998% of the underlying electricity demand in each region across the NEM to be met (Australian Energy Market Commission 2016). Reliability is a characteristic of the electricity system as a whole. It can be delivered by various elements contributing in different ways, rather than individual generators (or other resources) contributing in the same way. Because gas generators are dispatchable (i.e. they can be turned on and off), they can be used to balance the market during peak hours. On the other hand, solar and wind generators are variable – they cannot be dispatched, but are fed into the wholesale market when weather conditions permit generation. Coupling solar, wind and other variable technologies, either physically or through a financial contract with some form of storage would enable these technologies to deliver dispatchable electricity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As the proportion of solar and wind energy increases, various approaches will contribute to ensuring that reliability standards are met. These could include geographic diversity, energy source diversity, demand response and storage. A degree of underutilisation of variable renewable energy facilities will also increase the availability or capacity factor of individual facilities.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Key characteristics that vary between storage technologies are maximum power output (capacity), energy storage volume (which translates to a duration over which a particular level of power output can be maintained), response time, ramp rate and round-trip efficiency. Flexible resources have a faster ramp rate than non-flexible resources (such as coal) which makes them more suited to systems with high levels of variable generation, which require fast response times to changing electricity demand.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Pumped hydroelectricity storage is currently the most mature and economically viable form of flexible capacity. Pumped hydroelectricity storage power plants are not a new technology in Australia, but there have not been any notable projects in the past 30 years. At the time of writing, the only three PHES projects in Australia are Tumut 3 (1500 MW), part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme; Wivenhoe Dam (500 MW) near Brisbane; and the Shoalhaven scheme (240 MW) south of Sydney. These three projects are dual purpose: they are used for electricity generation as well as water catchment management. Feasibility studies are under way to develop PHES in the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the hydroelectric scheme in Tasmania, plus opportunities for off-river PHES.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Some forms of bioenergy, such as using sugarcane waste for electricity production, are mature technologies that have been used in Australia for decades. Alternative feedstocks and new, efficient technology developments are expected to lower the cost of bioenergy and increase its use, but bankability and availability of feedstock will limit its ability to provide large-scale balancing capacity. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Batteries are a maturing technology with an unparalleled level of modularity. Batteries are capable of being optimised for a wide variety of energy reliability and grid security applications. By choosing the power-to-energy ratio of the battery, the asset owner can both provide the optimal service mix for the market and help maximise revenue for the individual asset. Batteries are expected to continue on a cost trajectory similar to wind and solar PV. It remains to be seen whether they will be deployed at specific locations on the transmission and distribution networks to provide network support, or more widely across the electricity system (providing bulk storage or smoothing output at a specific generator). For example, batteries can offer fast responses when offering stability services akin to supercapacitors.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Concentrating solar thermal is a developing technology with the potential to store solar energy as heat (such as in molten salt) and convert it to energy through traditional steam turbines. Although the levelised cost of electricity of CST is still comparatively high, technology development shows promise for long-term cost reductions.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The integration of variable energy sources into an electricity system also requires management of frequency regulation, voltage, and system security challenges. New approaches to managing the security of the electricity system are required to account for the different physical characteristics of new forms of generation. For example, renewable technologies such as wind and solar PV connect to the grid via inverters rather than the spinning machines synchronised with the electricity system that are used by conventional fossil fuel plants. Examples of potential solutions to these issues are as follows:</p><ul style=\"margin:0;\"><li>Solar thermal, bioenergy and geothermal technologies spin turbines similar to those of a fossil fuel plant. </li><li>Batteries can provide a wide range of system security services, such as fast response and voltage support.</li><li>Advanced controls and ancillary equipment for wind and solar PV facilities can provide voltage control.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A renewable technology’s stage of development will be a key determinant of uptake during the coming decades. Most new technologies, including energy technologies, initially have higher costs than incumbent technologies. But, over time, the costs of new technologies are expected to decrease through technology learning – as their production cost decreases and technical performance increases (International Energy Agency 2012). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As an example, wind – as a proven and widely used technology – generally costs less per unit of electricity generation than many other renewable technologies. Those still at development and demonstration stage include a number of solar, ocean and geothermal technologies. As these technologies advance and technical issues are resolved, it is expected that costs will decrease, encouraging more widespread uptake. The rate of switching from older technologies to these new technologies will depend on the relative costs and the extent to which consumers value the long-term – and often, at that stage, uncertain – benefits of the new technology (International Energy Agency 2012). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Governments can also influence the rate at which a technology advances, through assistance in research and development, and in demonstration projects for new technologies. For example, the Australian Government has committed $2 billion to ARENA, which aims to increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia. </p><h4 >Investment</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The key Australian Government initiative aimed at encouraging new renewable energy projects in Australia is the RET. The RET will continue to support new investment in large-scale renewable technologies until 2020, when the NEG commences.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Most of the committed investment in large-scale renewable energy is in wind and solar projects, with an estimated $7 billion invested in projects actively under way in 2017 (Clean Energy Council 2017). It is expected that the 2020 RET can be met if the current investment momentum continues (Clean Energy Regulator 2016). </p><h4 >Renewable energy export potential</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The infrastructure to transform renewable energy into chemically stored alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen fuel or ammonia is at an early stage of development in Australia. If this infrastructure is developed and an export market is found, Australia may be able to export significant amounts of renewable energy. Renewable energy export could take the form of hydrogen, ammonia, energy embodied in processed minerals, or energy exported via HVDC connection to Asia. The liquid fuels could also provide an alternative domestic fuel supply – for example, for transport fuels (CSIRO 2017).</p><h3 >Electricity generation</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Population and economic growth in Australia are expected to continue strongly in the near term, putting upward pressure on electricity demand in both the residential and business sectors. These drivers are leading to greater numbers and types of electric appliances in homes, and greater service potential from these appliances. However, many other factors are putting downward pressure on per capita electricity consumption. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity demand in Australia has plateaued during the past ten years (<u><a href=\"#id.el7vep94ybj\" >Figure 12</a></u>), and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future as a result of the competing drivers of electricity demand, many of which are operating on the downside.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Uptake of renewable energy in Australia is growing rapidly – wind- and solar-generated electricity are the fastest growing renewable energy sectors. Wind and solar PV are currently the cheapest and most bankable forms of renewable energy in Australia. Recent wind and solar PV projects have reported levelised cost of electricity values of less than $60/MWh and $80/MWh, respectively, and rooftop solar PV is available at costs equal to, or lower than, electricity tariffs in most states and territories. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In combination with technologies such as bioenergy, pumped hydro, thermal storage, battery storage and demand response controls, renewables could make a significant contribution to meeting Australia’s electricity needs securely and reliably. A combination of continued technology cost reduction (through further local and international RD&#38;D, supply chain maturity and experience), increases in fossil fuel costs, a trend towards reduced emissions and a market switch towards greater electrification is expected to underpin a significant expansion in the use of renewables for electricity generation in the coming decades.</p><h4 >Industrial demand</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Structural change in the Australian economy is seeing greater growth in less energy-intensive sectors (such as the services sector) than in energy-intensive sectors (such as manufacturing). This is leading to flat or moderate growth in business and manufacturing demand for electricity. An exception to this trend is an increase in electricity demand to operate the CSG processing and production facilities supplying the Gladstone LNG facilities in Queensland.</p><h4 >Solar rooftop penetration</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The number of solar PV rooftop panel installations has grown rapidly, supported by state and territory government policies, and the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme. Costs are falling dramatically, and the penetration of solar PV is expected to increase. The opportunity to support solar panel generation with cost-effective household battery storage will further increase the attractiveness of this option. Solar rooftop hot water systems are also continuing to penetrate the market.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The uptake of distributed photovoltaics will have significant implications for the electricity system. Up to 45 per cent of electricity could be generated by distributed photovoltaics by 2050 (CSIRO and Energy Networks Australia 2017). This impact is likely to be realised earlier in locations with higher shares of solar PV. For example, in South Australia, instantaneous demand is likely to be met on certain days by distributed solar PV as early as 2022. The ability to orchestrate solar PV (i.e. operate distributed units in a collective way while managing the system as a whole) and other distributed energy resources to provide energy, network and system security services will be critical to managing this transition.</p><h4 >End-use efficiency</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Increasing the end-use efficiency of electrical equipment and of energy use within buildings is expected to have a major impact on energy demand. The Australian Energy Market Operator expects the combination of solar PV and energy efficiency to more than compensate for the growth in population and incomes in the longer term (Australian Energy Market Operator 2016b). Vehicle efficiency and industrial process heat are other areas expected to improve energy productivity.</p><h4 >Fuel switching</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Switching from gas or other fuelled appliances to electricity is likely to continue in the future. This will depend on the relative prices of electricity and other fuels such as gas, and on improvements in the efficiency of electric and gas appliances. In the long run, continued electrification of the economy to reduce carbon emissions is likely, including the transport sector. There is also the potential to switch from gas to biogas or hydrogen.</p><h4 >Carbon policies</h4><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is committed to a carbon target of a 26–28 per cent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement negotiated at the 21<sup>st</sup> Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2015, and signed by 174 countries in April 2016. Electricity generation accounts for more than 38 per cent of Australia’s carbon emissions. Achieving these targets will require innovations in low carbon generation on the supply side, and policies to support more efficient use of electricity on the demand side.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2017.

However, Australia has limited domestic supplies of oil (<u><a href=\"#id.xakz9qbft8ah\" >Figure 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.fo94evu6df96\" >Figure 6</a></u>; <u><a href=\"#kix.rukmc9h6h2i3\" >Table 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.nrp3o55r77ik\" >Table 2</a></u>). ‘Oil’ in this report refers to any hydrocarbon liquids, including conventional crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and unconventional shale oil and oil shales.</p><p >The production of oil in Australia has declined continually for some time. Production of both crude oil and condensate declined by approximately 30 per cent in 2014 compared with 2010. Most oil production has come from only a few major offshore fields. Australia imports most of its crude oil and refined petroleum liquids.</p><p >Recent crude oil exploration in Australia has not repeated the early success of the 1960s. Additions to crude oil resources do not match production withdrawals, even though production has decreased with time (78 million barrels [mmbbl] in 2014 compared with 102 mmbbl in 2011). The majority of Australia’s remaining petroleum liquid resources are condensate and LPG from a few supergiant and giant gas fields in the offshore Browse and Carnarvon basins.</p><p >The drop in the oil price globally since 2014 has not only significantly reduced companies’ exploration expenditure, it has also led to companies impairing their assets. The trend of decreasing oil resources booking is not expected to change within the known oil basins.</p><p >Australia has potentially significant unconventional oil resources, including shale oil and oil shale. Shale oil is liquid oil that can be extracted from shales using drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Oil shale is shale that contains immature kerogen, and requires mining and retorting to produce oil. Oil shale exploration has a long history, with large contingent resources reported in Queensland, but no significant production. Australia also has the potential to find large shale oil resources.</p><table><tr><td colspan=\"10\"  id=\"kix.rukmc9h6h2i3\"><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Table 1 Australia&#39;s total identified and prospective oil resources (PJ)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Resource category</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Crude oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Condensate</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">LPG</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Shale oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Oil shale</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Tight oil</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Reserves (2P)</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">3286</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">7421</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2633</p></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\" ></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">13 340</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Contingent resources (2C)</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">3780</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">9042</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">3324</p></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\" ></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">16 147</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">All identified resources (2P + 2C)</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">7066</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">16 463</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">5957</p></td><td></td><td></td><td colspan=\"2\" ></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">29 486</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Prospective resources</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">85 483</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">41 148</p></td><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">6 036 971</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">54 455</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2 934 120</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">9 152 178</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"10\" ><p >Note: These numbers have been rounded.

In AERA, petroleum resources are reported at 50 per cent confidence levels for each category of proven reserves (2P), contingent resources (2C) and best estimates of prospective resources. Identified resources comprise proven reserves and contingent resources. The classification used here is different from that used in previous versions of AERA, which used the McKelvey classification system. Although the total resources should not differ between these two systems, some statistical information may be affected – for example, the remaining resource production life, the calculation of which has changed from economic demonstrated resources/production to reserve/production.</p><p >Australia’s identified crude oil resources occur in 14 sedimentary basins. Significant volumes of oil resources are restricted to the offshore Mesozoic basins on the north-west margin and in Bass Strait. Onshore basins currently contribute only approximately 9.6 per cent of Australia’s total crude oil resources.</p><p >Australia has limited domestic supplies of crude oil (7066 petajoules [PJ]; 1202 mmbbl; <u><a href=\"#id.7u8h4z4xzlse\" >Figure 2</a></u>, <u><a href=\"#id.trf2vzw3axrq\" >Figure 7</a></u>). However, Australia has significant amounts of condensate and LPG resources associated with gas resources (<u><a href=\"#id.5j4pdncv3bmv\" >Figure 3</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.fx4fkalkvnqi\" >Figure 4</a></u>; <u><a href=\"#id.y40gxjn531j9\" >Figure 8</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.ya1agrnu2dbx\" >Figure 9</a></u>). At the end of 2014, remaining condensate resources were 16 463 PJ (2800 mmbbl) and LPG resources were 5957 PJ (1415 mmbbl). Australia’s largest remaining discovered liquid petroleum resource is the Ichthys condensate and LPG gas field in the offshore Browse Basin. It is estimated to contain more than 12 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas and 500 mmbbl of condensate (INPEX 2016).</p><p >Estimated crude oil reserves have decreased with time. This has steadied the crude oil remaining reserve production life, which has been nearly constant at approximately eight years. In contrast, condensate reserves have increased with time, associated with new gas development projects. The remaining condensate production life increased from approximately nine years in 2010 to more than 25 years in 2014. The remaining oil (combined crude oil, condensate and LPG) reserve production life in Australia is slightly more than 14 years.</p><p >A large amount of contingent resources are contained in unconventional oil shale accumulations, estimated at 84 435 PJ (14 360 mmbbl). However, under the current low oil price regime, the resources may remain undeveloped for some time.</p><h2 >Australia’s prospective resources</h2><p >Australia has good potential for increases in oil resources with further exploration activities (<u><a href=\"#id.pvztbt8zecm4\" >Figure 5</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.e2t42infbwlf\" >Figure 10</a></u>). The total undiscovered conventional oil resources have been estimated as 126 632 PJ (21 536 mmbbl), mainly in the offshore sedimentary basins. The United States Geological Survey has assessed the undiscovered conventional crude oil potential in four offshore basins (United States Geological Survey 2011). It estimated the prospective crude oil resources to range from 782 PJ (133 mmbbl) in the Gippsland Basin to 16 934 PJ (2880 mmbbl) in the Northern Carnarvon–Canning basins. The same study estimated that the undiscovered natural gas liquids (NGL; an American term that includes any liquids from gas production, except condensate) in these proven offshore basins ranged from 664 PJ (113 mmbbl) in the Gippsland Basin to 17 546 PJ (2984 mmbbl) in the Northern Carnarvon–Canning basins.</p><p >Petroleum potential exists in deepwater frontier basins, but the oil resource has not been identified. BP, Statoil, Chevron, Santos and Murphy have committed A$1.7 billion to explore the Bight Basin in Australia’s southern rift margin, where unrisked prospective recoverable oil resources are estimated as 9 billion barrels (Bbbl; Bight Petroleum 2016). Exploration and drilling activities in the Bight Basin may identify a basin with world-class oil potential.</p><p >Australia’s onshore basins are thought to have less potential for discovery of large conventional oil resources than the offshore sedimentary basins. The Cooper–Eromanga basins are considered the most prospective onshore basins for conventional oil resources. A recent assessment by the United States Geological Survey (2016) suggested that the Cooper–Eromanga holds approximately 0.5 per cent of Australia’s total undiscovered conventional oil potential.</p><p >Australia has significant potential for unconventional liquid petroleum resources hosted in oil shales, and shale and tight oil accumulations. The potential resources of shale gas liquids and light tight oil have only recently been recognised and assessed. </p><h3 >Geoscience Australia onshore unconventional resource assessments</h3><p >Geoscience Australia has assessed the potential for unconventional gas and oil in the onshore Gippsland, Otway, Perth, Cooper and Canning basins. This was a desktop assessment, using only publicly available data as inputs and following a probabilistic volumetric methodology. Results of the assessment are quoted at confidence levels of 10 per cent, 50 per cent, 90 per cent (P10, P50 and P90, respectively), and mean. Estimates of prospective resources in other basins are compiled using publicly available information.</p><p >Not all the oil-in-place will be extractable; an estimate of 5 per cent recovery was used. This recognises two factors. First, with few exceptions, there is no experience of how productive these reservoirs will be in Australia. Second, in the medium term (10–15 years), only a small amount of the oil-in-place could be extracted because of the very early stage of exploration and the time needed to better define resources before production commences. The assessments indicate large volumes of oil-in-place but with a high degree of uncertainty.

This is approximately 52 years supply at current production rates.</p><p >Since 1995, the world proven oil reserves have grown steadily as new reserves have been discovered and developed each year, including those from unconventional resources. Unconventional oil consists of a variety of liquid sources, including oil sands, extra heavy oil, tight oil, gas-to-liquids and other liquids. Heavy oil and tar sands have already changed the reserves picture for Venezuela and Canada, and light tight oil and shale liquids in the United States and elsewhere have proved to be a major new component of world oil supply.</p><p >Nearly half (47.7 per cent) of total world oil reserves are in the Middle East (<u><a href=\"#id.6f8lqx8c1ix3\" >Figure 11</a></u>). Three countries in this region – Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq – are in the top five of the world’s largest reserves. Saudi Arabia alone accounts for nearly 16 per cent (1 570 000 PJ; 267 billion barrels [Bbbl]) of world reserves. Venezuela has the largest share of world oil reserves, accounting for approximately 18 per cent. Canada has the third largest share of world oil reserves, although oil sands totalling some 982 548 PJ (167 Bbbl) account for approximately 97 per cent of these reserves. The Asia–Pacific region accounts for just 2.5 per cent of world oil reserves. The largest oil reserves in this region are in China (1.1 per cent).</p><p >In 2014, Australia accounted for just 0.2 per cent of world oil reserves and was ranked 25<sup>th</sup> in the world. Compared with the world’s proven conventional oil reserves, which may last approximately 52 years under current production rates, Australia’s oil reserves have a production life of only 14 years. However, Australia has significant prospective unconventional shale oil and oil shale resources that may be developed under different economic or technological conditions in the future.</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"  id=\"id.z5hfysiw279v\"><p style=\"margin-left:0;

The majority of oil production in Australia comes from offshore Western Australia (68 per cent), predominantly from the Carnarvon Basin, followed by offshore Victoria (13 per cent) and the onshore Cooper–Eromanga basins (11 per cent). Although Australia has more than 300 crude oil fields, most production has come from only a few major fields.</p><p >Australia’s primary production of oil (including LPG) in 2014–15 was 795 PJ (22.4 GL), which amounted to 13.4 per cent of total primary indigenous supply. Production has declined at an average annual rate of 4.6 per cent since the peak in 2000–01 when production was almost twice the current level (<u><a href=\"#kix.ymycz1wg5etn\" >Figure 14</a></u>). The fall in production is being driven by the depletion of mature oil fields, which has outweighed additions from new supply.</p><p >Approximately 78 per cent of Australian oil production (crude oil, NGL and LPG) was exported in 2014–15. Almost all of the remainder was used as input into Australian refineries for the production of a wide range of oil products (<u><a href=\"#id.mqp22vlv69i7\" >Figure 15</a></u>). Oil production refers to the processing of production fluids from oil wells to separate out the key components: oil, gas and produced water. However, the bulk of inputs into Australian refineries (83 per cent) were sourced from imports of oil and other refinery feedstocks. <u><a href=\"#id.atyluslmjs1y\" >Figure 16</a></u> shows the flows of production, imports and exports for crude oil and LPG, and for refined products.</p><p >World total oil production in 2014 was approximately 32.4 Bbbl (equivalent to ~190 309 PJ). The major oil producers are in the Middle East, which has a 30.5 per cent share of world production (<u><a href=\"#id.so78qwny949f\" >Figure 17</a></u>). Saudi Arabia is the largest single producer, accounting for approximately 13 per cent of world production, followed by the Russian Federation (12.5 per cent) and the United States (12.3 per cent).</p><p >Australia is a minor oil producer, ranking 31<sup>st</sup> in the world and accounting for 0.5 per cent of total oil production in 2014. The dramatic drop in oil price since 2014 has forced deep cuts in exploration spending across the industry, and discovery rates of new oil reserves have dropped to the lowest level in more than 60 years (IHS 2016).</p><h2 >Consumption</h2><p >Oil is consumed almost entirely as refined products, such as gasoline, aviation fuel and diesel. The transport sector is the largest consumer of oil products in Australia, with the majority being used in road and air transport. In 2014–15, oil consumption in the transport sector (including both Australian production, and imports of crude and refined product) accounted for approximately 71 per cent of the end-use sectors’ total oil consumption. Australia’s primary energy consumption of oil has increased at an average rate of 1.8 per cent per year during the past decade, and in 2014–15 amounted to 2237 PJ. Oil accounts for the largest share of Australian primary energy consumption at approximately 38 per cent in 2014–15, having overtaken coal consumption in 2010–11.</p><p >The petroleum refining industry in Australia produces a wide range of oil products, such as gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel and LPG, from crude oil and condensate feedstock. In 2014–15, Australian refineries consumed 1131 PJ of crude oil and condensate, mainly sourced from imports. Most of the imports are used in the domestic petroleum refining industry in eastern Australia to offset declining production from the Gippsland Basin.</p><p >The petroleum refinery industry in Australia has consolidated considerably in recent years, with three of seven refineries closing in the past decade. In 2012, the Clyde refinery in Sydney closed, followed by the Kurnell refinery in Sydney in 2014 and the Bulwer Island refinery in Brisbane in 2015. The remaining refineries in operation are the Kwinana refinery in Western Australia, the Geelong and Altona refineries in Victoria, and the Lytton refinery in Queensland. </p><p >In 2014–15, Australian refineries used approximately 30.6 gigalitres (GL) of feedstocks, of which approximately 84 per cent was sourced from imports (<u><a href=\"#id.4xqrvh18yvtl\" >Figure 18</a></u>).</p><h2 >Investment</h2><p >Between 2014 and 2015, two oil projects with a combined production capacity of 52 000 barrels per day were completed off the coast of Western Australia (<u><a href=\"#id.s3a83zvjfvx1\" >Table 4</a></u>). he Greater Enfield project in Western Australia is the only oil project in the investment pipeline, with a capacity of 70 million barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe; <u><a href=\"#id.g308qivps2cg\" >Table 5</a></u>).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\"  id=\"id.s3a83zvjfvx1\"><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Table 4 Projects at the completed stage, 2014–15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Project</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Owner</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">State</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Year</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Capacity (kbpd)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Balnaves</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Apache Energy/KUFPEC</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">WA</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2014</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coniston</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Apache Energy/Inpex</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">WA</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">22</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">kbpd = thousand barrels per day</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Source: Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (2014, 2015a)</p></td></tr></table><br /><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\"  id=\"id.g308qivps2cg\"><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Table 5 Projects at the feasibility stage, October 2015</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Project</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Owner</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">State</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Estimated start-up year</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Capacity (Mboe)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Greater Enfield</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Woodside/Mitsui E&#38;P Australia</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">WA</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2019+</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">70</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Mboe = million barrels of oil equivalent </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Source: Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (2015a)</p></td></tr></table><br /><h2 >Trade</h2><p >Australia is a net importer of refined oil products, as well as crude oil and other refinery feedstocks. In 2014–15, Australia imported 24.7 GL of crude oil and other refinery feedstocks worth $15 billion, and exported 15 GL worth $8.7 billion (<u><a href=\"#id.xgds679ddxgi\" >Figure 19</a></u>).</p><p >Australia has been a net importer of oil since the mid-1980s and, in 2014–15, imported 365 PJ more than was exported. Oil from Western Australia is largely exported, whereas oil from the smaller depleting fields in the east is largely consumed domestically.</p><p >Oil production off the coast of Western Australia is closer to Asian refineries than domestic refineries on the east coast, and the qualities and characteristics of Western Australian oil are more suited to export markets than to the Australian refineries. This makes it relatively more profitable to export the majority of Australia’s crude oil production. Falling east coast oil production has meant that domestic refineries on the east coast must increasingly rely on imported feedstock.</p><p >For most of the 1990s, Australia was a net exporter of refined petroleum products (<u><a href=\"#id.cvo60f4xh3us\" >Figure 20</a></u>). Since 2001–02, refinery closures and growing demand for petroleum products have resulted in net imports of refined products. During this period, net imports of refined petroleum products have grown by an average annual rate of 15 per cent to reach 28.3 GL in 2014–15. Exports of refined petroleum products in 2014–15 were 0.7 GL. The share of imports in total consumption of refined petroleum products increased from 11.6 per cent in 2002–03 to 51.2 per cent in 2014–15. In contrast, Australia is a net exporter in LPG. In 2014–15, Australia exported 2.1 GL of LPG valued at $807 million and imported 1.0 GL valued at $314 million.</p><h2 >Image gallery: World resources and markets</h2><p ><img id=\"id.6f8lqx8c1ix3\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Global oil demand is expected to grow strongly as standards of living rise, moderated by small declines in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of countries as end-use efficiencies improve.</p><p >Absent new discoveries, Australian crude oil production is expected to continue its decline, due to continuing declines in oil field reserves. However, there will be an increase in condensate production as new liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants are completed at Gorgon, Prelude and Ichthys off the coast of Western Australia. Within five years, condensate production will be approaching twice the production of crude oil in Australia.</p><h3 >Supply competitiveness</h3><p >If Australia is to sustain oil production, it will be essential to find and develop new, economically feasible oil fields.</p><p >The factors that will improve the outlook for exploration and development are:</p><ul style=\"margin:0;\"><li>higher oil prices, which will encourage greater investment by oil exploration companies;</li><li>improved production cost efficiencies and technological improvements; and</li><li>supportive government policies, including the petroleum resource rent tax regime and the annual release of offshore acreage, which encourage exploration for petroleum while ensuring an adequate return to the community.</li></ul><br /><p >Oil prices play a key role in the extent of upstream activity in the oil supply chain. Global oil prices are well below recent highs due to a global oversupply of oil. This oversupply has been led by the desire of the <u><a href=\"http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</a></u> (OPEC) to protect its market share in the face of expanding shale oil production by the United States. As a result of lower oil prices, expenditure on petroleum exploration in Australia has declined drastically to its lowest level since the March quarter of 2006, as companies look to implement cost-saving measures.</p><h3 >Demand competitiveness</h3><p >The future of oil consumption globally will be strongly influenced by competition from alternative transportation fuels such as electrification, compressed natural gas (CNG), LNG, biofuels, and hydrogen, and by international climate mitigation policies.</p><p >A critical mass of public charging stations has not yet been achieved in Australia for electric-only light passenger vehicles. The key advantage of battery-electric vehicles is their ability to plug into the existing grid at low incremental cost. However, electric vehicles still lag behind internal combustion engine vehicles in terms of affordability, and they may require government support to compete with incumbent technologies.</p><p >Although still far from being widely used in Australia, CNG and LNG vehicles have made some small inroads among large vehicles, urban buses and heavy-haul trucks on regular routes, where dedicated filling stations can be provided. </p><p >Second- and third-generation biofuel technologies are still in the development stage, with further laboratory testing and field trials needed before widespread deployment can occur. Hydrogen is being promoted, particularly in Japan, as a means to power fuel cells in vehicles. However, it suffers the same problem as electric and natural gas vehicles, which require an extensive network of recharging or refuelling stations.</p><p >Improved vehicle engine efficiency would maintain the competitiveness of oil products, while reducing the demand for oil and helping to extend the life of available oil reserves. </p><p >As the alternative options continue to shift down the cost curve, oil will face increasing competition in the transport sector. How to do business successfully in an increasingly carbon-constrained world is one of the key long-term challenges facing the oil industry.</p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p >Technological improvements in both the exploration and production of oil can provide access to previously inaccessible resources and reduce the cost of oil production from accumulations in difficult geological conditions and/or geographically remote locations. This will increase the volume of available reserves. Exploration for unconventional oil resources requires additional resource-specific datasets to be acquired compared with the data historically acquired for conventional oil resources. </p><p >Many new technologies have been introduced or are in development, including deepwater production technologies, enhanced recovery, and horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation (fracking) technologies. Research and development will be required to tailor engineering solutions to local geological conditions. For example, hydraulic fracturing is most effective when the orientation at which wells need to be drilled is understood, so that the fracturing can be optimally oriented to the local rock stress patterns.</p><h2 >References</h2><p >Bight Petroleum. 2016. 2D Drill Leads &#38; Resource Estimates. <a href=\"http://www.bightpetroleum.com/14830/2d-drill-leads-resource-estimates.htm\" target=\"_blank\">www.bightpetroleum.com/14830/2d-drill-leads-resource-estimates.htm</a> (last accessed 6 February 2018).</p><p >BP. 2015.

In this report, ‘gas resources’ refers to conventional and unconventional (including coal seam gas (CSG), shale gas and tight) gas resources. Gas is Australia’s third largest energy resource after coal and uranium. Australia’s identified conventional gas resources have grown substantially since discovery of the supergiant (&#62;10 trillion cubic feet [tcf]) and giant (&#62;3 tcf) gas fields on the North West Shelf in the early 1970s. Gas resources have increased more than fivefold during the past 40 years. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Most of the conventional gas resources (approximately 95 per cent) are found in the Carnarvon, Browse, Bonaparte and Gippsland basins off the north-west and south-east coasts of Australia. These resources have been progressively developed for domestic use and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia also has significant unconventional gas resource potential, including CSG, shale gas and tight gas, in many onshore basins. Exploration for unconventional gas resources has been widespread around the country. Significant CSG resources have been identified in the major coal basins of eastern Australia, and are being developed for LNG export and domestic use. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s total identified gas resources are approximately 279 685 petajoules ([PJ]; 257 tcf), which is sufficient to enable expansion of Australia’s domestic and export production capacity (<u><a href=\"#id.jj0icaucxkg\" >Table 1</a></u>). These resources are equal to approximately 106 years of gas at current production rates, of which the gas reserves account for 47 years. </p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"11\"  id=\"id.jj0icaucxkg\"><p >Table 1 Australia&#39;s total identified and prospective gas resources</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Resource category</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Conventional gas</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coal seam gas</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Tight gas</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Shale gas</p></td><td colspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total gas</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">tcf</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">tcf</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">tcf</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">tcf</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">tcf</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Reserves</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">77 253</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">70</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">45 895</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">43</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">39</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">123 187</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">114</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Contingent resources</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">108 982</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">99</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">33 555</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">32</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">1709</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">12 252</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">11</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">156 498</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">143</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">All identified resources</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">186 235</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">169</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">79 450</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">75</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">1748</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">12 252</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">11</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">279 685</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">257</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Prospective resources</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">235 913</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">215</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">6890</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">7<sup>a</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2 650 622</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">2410</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">9 577 353</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">8707</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">12 470 778</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">11 337</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"11\" ><p >a.

In AERA, petroleum resources are reported at 50 per cent confidence levels for each category of proven reserves (2P), contingent resources (2C) and best estimates of prospective resources. Identified resources comprise proven reserves and contingent resources. The classification used here is different from that used in previous versions of AERA, which used the McKelvey classification system. Although the total resources should not differ between these two systems, some statistical information may be affected – for example, the remaining resource production life, the calculation of which has changed from economic demonstrated resources/production to reserve/production.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">At the end of 2014, Australia’s total identified conventional gas resources were estimated at 186 235 PJ (169 tcf). At current production rates, there are sufficient gas reserves (77 253 PJ; 70 tcf) of conventional gas to last another 34 years (<u><a href=\"#id.w9lb4zrvklb2\" >Figure 2</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.wdra4smbexst\" >Figure 5</a></u>). Gas reserves are expected to increase substantially as new gas development projects convert current contingent resources into reserves to meet production projections. For example, the recent development of the Ichthys field in the Browse Basin has added significantly to Australia’s reserves of both gas and condensate.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coal seam gas is expected to remain the most important sector of the unconventional gas industry in the near term. It is already a significant source of domestic gas and LNG exports in eastern Australia. Australia’s identified CSG reserves have grown substantially in recent years. In 2014, the CSG reserves in Australia were 45 895 PJ (43 tcf) and accounted for approximately 38 per cent of the total gas reserves. Reserve life is approximately 130 years at current rates of CSG production. More than 93 per cent of the reported CSG reserves are in Queensland; the remainder are in New South Wales. In addition to reserves, Australia has substantial contingent resources (33 555 PJ; 32 tcf) of CSG. No reserves have been reported for deep CSG exploration to date.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Tight gas contingent resources are currently defined in the Cooper, Gippsland and Perth basins. The total contingent resource is currently less than 2 tcf, but is expected to grow as exploration for tight gas resources progresses.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Early exploration for shale gas resources has defined 11 tcf of contingent resources. Approximately 80 per cent of the reported contingent resources exist in the Cooper Basin. Santos reported first shale gas production and 3 PJ of gas reserves from the Moomba field in the Cooper Basin in 2012, but no significant shale gas reserves have been reported from other basins. This reflects the very early stage of exploration, a lack of infrastructure, and low oil and gas prices.</p><h2 >Australia’s prospective resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The development of new technologies and play concepts, and the advance of exploration into proven basins and frontier areas mean that there are further opportunities for large conventional gas discoveries on- and offshore, and for unconventional discoveries onshore (<u><a href=\"#id.m5wqjrnxvodj\" >Figure 3</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.4byf0t1yppe0\" >Figure 6</a></u>). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Additional conventional gas resources are very likely to be found in Australia. At the mean expectation, a total of 125 400 PJ (114 tcf) of yet-to-find recoverable conventional gas has been estimated in the Carnarvon, Bonaparte, Browse and Gippsland basins (Geoscience Australia and ABARE 2010). An assessment of the same basins by the United States Geological Survey (Pollastro et al. 2012) suggested a total of 235 913 PJ (214 tcf).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia also has significant potential for additional unconventional gas resources, including CSG, shale gas and tight gas. Exploration for CSG has focused on two types: gas associated with shallow coal seams and gas in deep coal formations. Shallow coal seams contain the majority of identified CSG resources. Deep coal gas is being explored for in some basins, including the Cooper and Galilee basins.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Estimates for CSG prospective resources are rare, but the best available data give a combined contingent and prospective CSG resource in Queensland and New South Wales of 122 558 PJ (111 tcf) and 68 375 PJ (62 tcf), respectively (Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation 2011). Other Australia-wide industry estimates range from 275 000 PJ (250 tcf) to more than 330 000 PJ (300 tcf) of gas-in-place (Arrow Energy 2009; Santos 2009).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Understanding of the potential tight gas and shale gas resources in Australia is limited. Likely shale gas candidate formations have been identified in many basins, including the Cooper, Perth, Amadeus, Canning, Georgina and McArthur basins. Tight gas resources are under investigation in the Cooper, Perth and Gippsland basins. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Numeric estimates of potential shale and tight gas resources have a high degree of uncertainty. The Upstream Petroleum Resources Working Group of the Council of Australian Governments estimated 680 900 PJ (619 tcf) of prospective recoverable shale and tight gas resources for the nation (Upstream Petroleum Resources Working Group 2015). Previous shale gas resource estimates include technically recoverable resources of 480 700 PJ (437 tcf) (Energy Information Administration 2013) and more than 1 100 000 PJ (1000 tcf) if all prospective basins are considered (Cook et al. 2013). </p><h3 >Geoscience Australia Onshore Unconventional Resources Assessment</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geoscience Australia has assessed the potential for unconventional gas and oil in the onshore Gippsland, Otway, Perth, Cooper and Canning basins. This desktop assessment used only publicly available Australia-specific data as inputs and used a probabilistic volumetric methodology. Results of the assessment are quoted at confidence levels of 10 per cent, 50 per cent, 90 per cent (P10, P50 and P90, respectively), and mean. Estimates of prospective resources in other basins are compiled using publicly available information.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Not all the gas-in-place will be extractable; an estimate of 5 per cent recovery was used. This recognises two factors. First, with few exceptions, there is no experience of how productive these reservoirs will be in Australia. Second, in the medium term (10–15 years), only a small amount of the gas-in-place could be extracted because of the very early stage of exploration and the time needed to better define resources before production commences. The assessments indicate large volumes of gas-in-place but with a high degree of uncertainty. The ‘potentially recoverable gas resources’ in <u><a href=\"#id.w7q8oxbanvet\" >Table 2</a></u> can be regarded as prospective resources. </p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\"  id=\"id.w7q8oxbanvet\"><p >Table 2 Shale and tight gas assessment results in selected basins</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\" ><p style=\"margin-left:0;

Natural gas production in Australia increased at a ten-year average annual growth rate of 6 per cent, from 1638 PJ in 2004–05 to 2845 PJ in 2014–15. Gas production includes production from the Bayu/Undan gas field in the Bonaparte Basin in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The most significant conventional gas–producing basins are the Carnarvon, Bonaparte and Gippsland basins. Conventional gas production has been maintained at approximately 2200 PJ (2 tcf) per year since 2009 (<u><a href=\"#id.i63vj1h4giwu\" >Figure 13</a></u>). In 2014–15, conventional gas accounted for approximately 86 per cent of Australia’s gas production at 2232 PJ, with a five-year average annual growth rate of 4 per cent. Approximately 89 per cent of the conventional gas production in 2014–15 was from Western Australia (72.4 per cent) and Victoria (16.5 per cent). It is expected that conventional gas production will increase substantially as the Wheatstone LNG project in the Carnarvon Basin, and the Ichthys and Prelude projects in the Browse Basin ramp up to full operational capacity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Currently, production of CSG is mainly from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland with a very small amount produced from the Sydney Basin in New South Wales. Although CSG represents only 14 per cent of gas production in Australia, the growth rate of CSG production outpaced that of conventional gas production during the five years ending 2014–15 and has continued to grow rapidly. Australia’s CSG production increased at a five-year average annual growth rate of 9 per cent. This growth is attributable to the expansion of LNG production from the three CSG to LNG plants near Gladstone, Queensland (Queensland Curtis LNG, Gladstone LNG and Australia Pacific LNG), which are now fully operational.</p><h2 >Consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Domestic consumption of natural gas has grown steadily, at a ten-year average annual rate of 3.7 per cent from 997 PJ in 2004–05 to 1431 PJ in 2014–15 (<u><a href=\"#id.lv5t7o8dkuzz\" >Figure 14</a></u>). Natural gas is now the third largest energy sector in Australia, making up nearly one-quarter of Australia’s total primary energy consumption in 2014–15. However, the share of total production used for domestic consumption has been falling, and in 2014–15 represented only approximately half of the natural gas produced in Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Gas consumption between the states and territories, and between industry sectors in Australia varies substantially. Nearly 80 per cent of total natural gas consumption in 2014–15 came from Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria (<u><a href=\"#id.g10tw97gzx54\" >Figure 15</a></u>). In Western Australia and Queensland, the consumption of natural gas has increased significantly during the past ten years, growing at an average annual rate of 4.7 per cent for Western Australia and 11.4 per cent for Queensland (<u><a href=\"#id.wc8y78sc9eqo\" >Figure 16</a></u>). Slower growth in natural gas consumption was evident in the remaining states during the same period.</p><p >Significant drivers of this growth in natural gas consumption have been strong underlying economic growth, the substantial expansion of the Australian LNG industry and government policies to support the uptake of gas.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The electricity generation and manufacturing sectors are the major users of gas in Australia, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of total natural gas consumption in 2014–15 (<u><a href=\"#id.tc1gl66bxufi\" >Figure 17</a></u>). Consumption of natural gas for electricity generation has shown a rapid increase since 2004–05, growing at a ten-year average annual rate of 7.9 per cent to 563 PJ in 2014–15.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The key contributor to the growth of natural gas for domestic consumption in Australia during the past ten years has been the strong growth in the electricity supply sectors in Queensland and Western Australia. For example, gas consumption by Queensland’s electricity supply sector grew from just 22 PJ in 2004–05 to 167 PJ in 2014–15. This sector accounted for approximately 58 per cent of total natural gas consumption in Queensland in 2014–15. Similarly, natural gas consumption by the electricity supply sector in Western Australia grew from just over 104 PJ in 2005–05 to 246 PJ in 2014–15 (a ten-year average annual average growth rate of 9.1 per cent). This sector accounted for more than 44 per cent of total gas consumption in Western Australia in 2014–15.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation from gas increased substantially during the past decade, reflected in the rapid increase in gas consumption by the electricity supply sector in Australia (<u><a href=\"#id.wr4cjirajymd\" >Figure 18</a></u>). Gas-fired electricity generation grew at an average annual rate of 8 per cent during the decade, from 23.8 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2004–05 to 52.5 TWh in 2014–15, and now accounts for more than 20 per cent of total electricity generation in Australia. However, gas-fired electricity generation decreased by approximately 3.6 per cent in 2014–15 compared with 2013–14; this is largely attributable to higher gas prices in Australia with the expansion of LNG exports. In 2014–15, 54 per cent of electricity generation in Western Australia came from natural gas, followed by South Australia (38 per cent) and Queensland (27 per cent; <u><a href=\"#id.8kf2n8f5a7lt\" >Figure 19</a></u>).</p><p >The consumption of natural gas in the mining sector (including for oil and gas extraction) also increased substantially during the period, growing at an average annual rate of 10 per cent over the decade to 25 PJ in Queensland, and at a rate of 6 per cent to 106 PJ in Western Australia.</p><h2 >Investment</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A number of gas projects, including both upstream and LNG projects, were completed between 2014 and December 2016 (<u><a href=\"#id.gpaym8md3ati\" >Table 4</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.xwzlfkfyugy3\" >Table 5</a></u>). This included the Greater Western Flank (phase 1) and Xena Gas Field (phase 1) upstream gas projects, and the three CSG to LNG plants in Gladstone, which have a combined nameplate capacity of 25.3 Mtpa. Total LNG production in Australia is expected to increase to approximately 87 Mtpa by the end of 2018, with the completion of four LNG projects on the west coast (<u><a href=\"#id.7427a2qme5s\" >Table 6</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at December 2016, seven upstream gas projects were committed across Australia.

Demand growth in the domestic market is expected to be restrained, accompanied by a decline in the gas-powered electricity generation market in eastern Australia. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The future development and use of Australia’s gas resources will depend on the outlook for LNG exports, the role of gas in the domestic market as Australia moves to reduce carbon emissions, trends in gas prices, and incentives to find and develop new gas reserves across Australia.</p><h3 >Australian LNG exports</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian exports of LNG have been ramping up rapidly as new LNG plants are progressively commissioned to support the rapidly growing global demand for LNG. Global supply is also growing rapidly and is likely to exceed the growth in demand over the next five years, which will put downward pressure on both spot and contract prices. As a consequence, new LNG developments in Australia are not anticipated until the global market begins to tighten. In the meantime, the international market will become increasingly cost competitive. The best prospect for further development of LNG exports lies with brownfield developments at existing plants. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although the long-term outlook is positive, the global LNG market is becoming increasingly dynamic. This is affected by three main factors. First, overall gas demand is uncertain because of growing competition between gas, renewables and coal for electricity generation. Second, the LNG market is becoming more flexible and dynamic; spot and short-term trading now accounts for approximately 30 per cent of the market. In addition, there is a trend to hub trading and gas-on-gas pricing, which better reflect the dynamics of gas supply and demand. Third, there is greater supply-side competition from alternative LNG suppliers, including the United States, Russia and potentially east Africa, and from pipeline supply and indigenous production in the major growth markets. These trends mean that prospective LNG developments must be cost competitive and responsive to market trends.</p><h3 >Domestic gas demand</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Domestic gas consumption has grown strongly since the introduction of natural gas into the Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane markets in 1969. However, the combined effect of higher gas prices, greater energy efficiency, concerns about the adequacy of gas supplies and increasing competition from renewables in electricity generation are expected to moderate demand growth in the industrial sector and reduce gas-fired electricity generation in eastern Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Gas has been seen as a potential transition fuel to a low carbon emissions future. Whether this eventuates in the longer term depends on a range of factors, including specific policies adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the trend to higher end-use energy efficiencies and the cost of new technologies that compete with gas. For example, in the residential sector, reverse-cycle air-conditioning is competitive with gas for home heating, and solar hot water is a viable alternative to gas-fired units. In the electricity generation sector, solar photovoltaics and wind power are on a downward cost trajectory. Conversely, gas is a dispatchable technology that stabilises electricity systems, and gas peaking electricity generation is a flexible backup to intermittent renewable generation.</p><h3 >Gas prices</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Domestic gas prices respond to imbalances in gas supply and demand, the growth in the underlying costs of production, and netback pricing from LNG export facilities (netback prices reflect the opportunity value of gas that can be sold overseas as LNG, after deducting the costs of liquefaction, transport and regasification). Netback prices are in turn affected by LNG prices and the exchange rate, as LNG sales are usually denominated in United States dollars. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Prices in eastern Australia have risen during the past two years; this is associated with the partial connection of the domestic market to LNG export markets. As older long-term contracts roll off, users are increasingly facing higher prices and shorter-term contracts. This connection of the domestic market to the LNG export market is likely to lead to greater price volatility over time, in line with the volatility of the global LNG price. </p><h3 >Gas reserves</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has extensive reserves of conventional gas off the north-west coast of Western Australia and large CSG reserves in south-east Queensland, which together support LNG export markets and contribute to the domestic market. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In eastern Australia, the domestic markets south of Queensland are mainly supplied from the Bass Strait basins and the Cooper Basin. However, the Bass Strait basins are in decline, and the CSG reserves in Queensland supply (in part) an LNG export market more than twice the size of the eastern Australian domestic market. Therefore, the key issues facing the domestic market are the incentives to install new production capacity, and the incentives and barriers to finding and developing new gas reserves to replace fields as they decline. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">New production capacity is expensive to develop, and requires a stable investment market and parties willing to contract for the gas supply. The current subdued investment climate and uncertain market demand are disincentives to investment in this sector.</p><h3 >Other challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There are barriers to finding and developing new onshore gas fields, in part due to growing community concerns regarding the impacts of gas extraction, particularly unconventional gas. Building and maintaining social licence to ensure acceptance or approval by local stakeholders for a development will be an ongoing challenge for unconventional gas exploration and extraction.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In addition, there are regulatory and policy barriers to finding and developing new onshore gas fields – for example, exploration moratoria and bans on hydraulic fracture stimulation (fracking) in Victoria, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Arrow Energy Ltd. 2009.

In 2016, <i>in situ</i> Economic Demonstrated Resources (EDR) of black and brown coal amounted to 86 261 million tonnes (Mt) and 92 887 Mt, respectively. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Recoverable resources, however, are a more useful assessment of coal endowment as these estimates include losses that occur during mining and processing. As at December 2016, Australia’s total recoverable Identified Resources of black coal were estimated at 157 046 Mt, of which recoverable EDR were 70 439 Mt (<u><a href=\"#id.9nt04i5j7x2c\" >Figure 2</a></u>). Australia is ranked fifth in the world for recoverable black coal. At 2015 production levels, Australia’s EDR of accessible recoverable black coal could last approximately 140 years.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at December 2016, the total recoverable Identified Resource of brown coal was estimated at 436 648 Mt, of which recoverable EDR were 76 508 Mt. Australia is ranked second in the world in terms of recoverable brown coal. At 2015 production levels, Australia has approximately 1095 years of accessible recoverable brown coal EDR.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In Australia, black coal is produced in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. The vast majority of Australia’s production of black coal is exported to overseas markets. The gap between domestic production and consumption of black coal has continued to rise over recent years as a result of growing global demand for quality metallurgical coal and thermal coal, and a decline in domestic consumption. In contrast to black coal, all brown coal mined in Australia is used almost exclusively for domestic electricity generation in Victoria, where it is burnt in adjacent power plants, although a small mine at Maddingley, 50 km north-west of Melbourne, produces agricultural products. The Anglesea power station on Victoria’s south coast closed in 2015, and the Hazelwood power station to the east of Melbourne closed in 2017, leaving Loy Yang and Yallourn the only coal-fired power stations operating in Victoria.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Black coal is a major export commodity for Australia; the 2016 export earnings from black coal were more than $34.5 billion (Department of Industry Innovation and Science 2017). Japan and other Asian countries are prime destinations for Australian coal. The Australian coal industry employs almost 40 000 people directly (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016) and potentially many more in associated industries, chiefly in rural and regional areas.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Despite the growing popularity of alternative energy technologies, coal continues to be important for both domestic and global electricity generation. Coal-fired generation accounted for 63 per cent of Australia&#39;s electricity generation in 2014–15 and 41 per cent of global electricity generation (Department of Industry Innovation and Science 2016a; World Coal Association 2016). Despite the decline in the percentage share of coal in the global electricity mix, the World Coal Association projects that, in absolute terms, the amount of coal-fired electricity generation will grow as the total amount of electricity generation increases worldwide, particularly in developing regions. The high volume of mining investment in Australia during the past decade has translated into increased production capacity, enabling the sector to meet growing demand and support increased export earnings from coal (Department of Industry Innovation and Science 2016b).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.4aduublkac4j\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Subeconomic Resources are mineral resources that are currently deemed unsuitable for economic extraction but could potentially be used in the future. Inferred Resources are a less accurate estimate of a resource. They are those parts of a mineral deposit that are estimated at the lowest level of confidence; they are neither economic nor subeconomic because there is not enough information to make this determination. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A range of coal quality specifications are preferred for different markets. The specific energy of the coal is the amount of coal required to produce a given heat output – this is an important parameter for the thermal coal market. Ash is the non-combustible portion that remains when coal is heated at a high temperature, and coal also naturally contains some moisture. Both ash and the presence of moisture dilute the amount of energy that a coal can produce. Coal ash creates extra costs due to the requirement for capture and disposal, whereas moisture increases the relative freight cost per unit of energy. Other important coal quality parameters include sulphur, volatile matter and carbon levels (Coalfield Geology Council of New South Wales 2011).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at 31 December 2016, Australia had substantial EDR (<u><a href=\"#id.4aduublkac4j\" >Figure 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.9nt04i5j7x2c\" >Figure 2</a></u>) and Inferred Resources of black and brown coal, which contribute considerably to Australia’s resource potential (<u><a href=\"#id.dnk21yf88z6j\" >Figure 3</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.wnplrocan3hm\" >Figure 4</a></u>).</p><h3 >Black coal</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Most of Australia’s black coal resources are in the Bowen and Sydney basins, in Queensland and New South Wales, respectively. Black coal resources are also found in the Surat, Clarence-Moreton and Galilee basins in Queensland, and in the Gunnedah Basin in New South Wales. Premium black coal (also called coking coal, metallurgical coal or met coal) is mostly used for steel making and other industrial processes. Lower-quality black coal (also called thermal coal or steaming coal) is used for electricity production.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total <i>in situ</i> resources of black coal in Australia (EDR plus Subeconomic Resources plus Inferred Resources) are estimated at 197 069 Mt, comprising 86 261 Mt of EDR, 5791 Mt of Subeconomic Resources and 105 017 Mt of Inferred Resources. Australia’s total recoverable Identified Resources of black coal are estimated to be 157 046 Mt, comprising 70 439 Mt of EDR, 4833 Mt of Subeconomic Resources and 81 774 Mt of Inferred Resources.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2016, the estimate of Australia’s recoverable EDR of black coal were revised upwards to 70 439 Mt, an increase of 2147 Mt, or 3.1 per cent, from the previous year. In 2016, large additions to EDR in the Sydney Basin came from four deposits: Dartbrook (Australian Pacific Coal), Mount Arthur (BHP Billiton Limited), Mount Thorley (Rio Tinto) and Warkworth (Rio Tinto). In the Bowen Basin, four projects owned by a BHP Billiton Limited/Mitsubishi Corporation joint venture reported large additions to EDR: Goonyella, Peak Downs, Peak Downs East and Saraji East. In the Galilee Basin, the Milray Project (Glencore) also reported increased EDR.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2016, large contributions to Inferred Resources from the Bowen Basin included the BHP Billiton Limited/Mitsubishi Corporation joint-venture projects Peak Downs and Peak Downs East. The Columboola (Metro Mining Limited) and Clifford (Stanmore Coal Limited) projects in the Surat Basin in Queensland reported a large increase in Inferred Resources. In the Sydney Basin, Dartbrook (Australian Pacific Coal) and the United Project (Glencore) also reported large increases in Inferred Resources. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2016, the Hutton Coking Coal Project (Valiant Resources) in the Bowen Basin reported maiden Reserves.</p><h3 >Brown coal</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">For brown coal, total <i>in situ</i> resources (all categories) are estimated to be approximately 496 269 Mt (of which <i>in situ</i> EDR are 92 887 Mt, Subeconomic Resources are 279 056 Mt and Inferred Resources are 124 326 Mt). Total recoverable Identified Resources of brown coal are estimated at 436 648 Mt (of which recoverable EDR are 76 508 Mt, Subeconomic Resources are 256 561 Mt and Inferred Resources are 103 579 Mt). Nearly all of Australia’s recoverable brown coal EDR is in Victoria, with more than 93 per cent in the Latrobe Valley.</p><br /><h2 ><u><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16Ojz-tEgfDAWIppLndOO9-WFSh3NpQKU\" target=\"_blank\">Download resources data</a></u></h2><br /><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0;

The majority of Australia’s black coal mines are in Queensland and New South Wales, which accounted for approximately 48 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively, of Australia’s 2014–15 coal production <u><a href=\"#id.3d4qfn1cu2xq\" >(Figure 7</a></u>). Brown coal produced in Victoria, mainly from the Gippsland Basin, contributed 12.3 per cent to total coal production in 2014–15.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, Australia’s production of saleable black and brown coal was 12 966 PJ, which accounted for nearly 78 per cent of total energy production. Over the past decade, coal production has grown by an average annual rate of 4 per cent, moderated by a fall of 5.3 per cent in production in 2010–11 due to flooding in Queensland (<u><a href=\"#id.99x1vb858nft\" >Figure 8</a></u>). The bulk of the production growth experienced in this period was driven by growth in export markets. In 2014–15, 90 per cent of domestic black coal production was exported (<u><a href=\"#id.5c6lbhcs7ltz\" >Figure 9</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2015, Australia accounted for approximately 7 per cent of the world&#39;s black coal production, and was the world’s third largest producer after China (55 per cent) and India (11 per cent). Australia accounted for approximately 6 per cent of the world&#39;s brown coal production in 2015, and was the fourth largest producer after the United States (30 per cent), Indonesia (16 per cent) and Germany (12 per cent; International Energy Agency 2016c).</p><h2 >Consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Following five years of decreases due to the decline in coal-fired electricity generation, and reduced demand from the iron and steel manufacturing sector, Australia’s net coal consumption rebounded to approximately 1908 PJ in 2014–15. Coal use increased by 3 per cent in 2014–15 compared with the previous year due to increased use of black and brown coal for electricity generation. Despite this recent increase, Australia’s coal consumption remains approximately 20 per cent lower in 2014–15 than at its peak in 2008–09, when its share of the total primary energy mix was more than 40 per cent (<u><a href=\"#id.gaacvpwz855p\" >Figure 10</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation from coal has decreased from its peak in 2006–07 due to falling electricity demand and increasing penetration of renewables. Over the period 2006–07 to 2014–15, coal-fired electricity generation declined at an average rate of 2 per cent a year, from nearly 187 terawatt hours (TWh) to 158.6 TWh (<u><a href=\"#id.df7cbohgv98c\" >Figure 11</a></u>). The share of coal-fired generation has declined by approximately 25 per cent since the peak level in 1997–98 to 63 per cent, as gas and renewables have increased their share. Despite the recent declines in coal generation, it rebounded slightly in 2014–15 due to reduced water availability for hydroelectricity generation and higher gas prices. This also coincided with the removal of the carbon price.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland accounted for 92 per cent of total coal-fired generation nationally. All three states have a relatively large reliance on coal for electricity generation (<u><a href=\"#id.2soa6pmlqpof\" >Figure 12</a></u>), whereas other states have a relatively heavier reliance on natural gas and renewable energy.</p><h2 >Trade</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia exports the majority of its coal, capitalising on its abundant coal reserves and strong ongoing coal demand from Asia. The total value of coal exports decreased by 37 per cent from peak levels of $54.7 billion in 2008–09 to $34.5 billion in 2015–16 due to falls in contract prices for Australian coal exports (<u><a href=\"#id.27puu5s1q843\" >Figure 13</a></u>). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Despite lower prices, Australian coal export volumes (<u><a href=\"#id.n8lgmpw5rwyz\" >Figure 14</a></u>) have continued to increase as a result of growing demand from importing countries such as China and the Republic of Korea. Coal export volumes grew at an average annual rate of 5 per cent from 2004–05 to 2014–15. China has played a major role in the recent increases in Australian coal export volumes, with total coal exports increasing by almost 40 per cent over the four years to 2014–15.</p><h2 >Investment</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Coal exploration expenditure in 2016 declined by 58 per cent to $124 million, the lowest since 2005 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2017). However, Australian coal producers have been partially cushioned over the past few years by the weakening Australian dollar offsetting the fall in the United States dollar international price.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at December 2016, no coal-fired electricity plants were under construction in Australia. However, the 150 MW capacity Moray Power Station was at the feasibility stage. It is proposed as the main power supply to Adani’s Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland; the construction of this power station is entirely dependent on the mine proceeding.</p><h2 >Image gallery</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.9nt04i5j7x2c\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

The majority (80 per cent) of this coal will be exported to satisfy growing demand for coal-fired electricity generation from countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, most notably in Asia. Modest growth in metallurgical coal exports (97 per cent of which is exported) to support global steel production is also anticipated.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">After a temporary spike in 2017, prices are expected to moderate and remain low in the medium term.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The future development and use of Australia’s coal resources will depend on the ability of coal to contribute to the growing standard of living in countries around the world, the evolution of carbon mitigation policies and the ability of coal to compete with low carbon technologies.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Domestically and internationally, government policies such as the Renewable Energy Target have encouraged the growth of renewables; wind and solar energy, in particular, have increased their share in the electricity generation mix. During the past decade, the cost competitiveness of renewables and enabling technologies such as battery storage has continued to improve in comparison with coal. As the penetration of renewables continues to rise, the growing challenge of grid integration will be a key determinant of the electricity generation supply mix. If renewable energy can be integrated into the grid in a sustainable, affordable and reliable manner, the global demand for coal in electricity generation may decrease.</p><h3 >Technological innovation</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Technological advances will play an important role in ensuring that coal can continue to be consumed around the world in a manner that meets economic and environmental objectives. These advances aim to increase the efficiency of, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from, coal-fired power generation. Most of Australia’s existing coal-fired power plants are based on subcritical generation technology. Subcritical coal plants have the lowest efficiency and highest emissions when compared with the latest supercritical and ultra-supercritical coal plants. To refurbish or replace subcritical plants, many of which have significant remaining technical operating lives, with supercritical or ultra-supercritical technology would require major capital investment.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A number of approaches can improve the efficiency of existing coal plants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without significant upgrades or expenditure – for example, more efficient steam turbines, improvements in boiler efficiency, and co-firing with gas or biomass. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a greenhouse gas mitigation technology that can potentially reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing and future coal-fired power stations by more than 80 per cent. Reducing carbon emissions using CCS requires the capture, transport (as a supercritical fluid) and geological storage of carbon dioxide. This technology will be used in Australia at Chevron’s Gorgon LNG project, which has developed a commercial-scale CCS project at Barrow Island off the Western Australia coast. However, unless this technology matures further and costs decline, investment in, and implementation of, CCS will add significantly to the cost of electricity production.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2016.

Australia has the world’s largest Economic Demonstrated Resources (EDR) of uranium – 1270 thousand tonnes of uranium (kt U; 711 076 petajoules [PJ]) – and is the world’s third largest producer of uranium. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2017, Australia had three producing uranium mines: Olympic Dam and Four Mile in South Australia, and Ranger in the Northern Territory. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian uranium supply has declined moderately over the past ten years, mainly due to the closure of two mines in 2014 and 2015. In the medium term, Australian production of uranium may increase moderately.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Extracting the latent energy value of thorium in a cost-effective manner remains a challenge, and will require considerable research and development investment (World Nuclear Association 2017a). Such investment has been occurring mostly in China, with modest support from the United States. Another challenge is that thorium can only be used as a fuel in conjunction with a fissile material such as recycled plutonium. There has been only one commercial-scale thorium-fuelled nuclear plant – the Fort St Vrain reactor in Colorado, United States. Commercial technologies to use thorium as a nuclear reactor fuel are still some decades away. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Because there are currently no commercial applications for thorium, world production and consumption rates are negligible. Thorium is not produced in Australia, and production on a large scale is unlikely in the next few decades.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia currently has no plans to have a domestic nuclear power industry by 2030. However, interest in the industry increased with the establishment of the South Australian Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission in March 2015 and the release of its report in May 2016 (Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.fe019cmzgv1i\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Concentrations of uranium-rich minerals, such as uraninite, carnotite and brannerite, can form economically recoverable deposits. The majority of Australia&#39;s uranium occurs in four main types of deposit: iron oxide breccia complexes, unconformity-related resources, sandstone resources and paleochannel/calcrete-style resources.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Once mined, uranium is processed into uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), also referred to as uranium oxide concentrate, and it is exported in this form. Natural uranium (from mine production) contains approximately 0.7 per cent of the uranium isotope U<sup>235</sup> and 99.3 per cent U<sup>238</sup>.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at December 2016, Australia’s uranium EDR were 1270 kt U (711 076 PJ). An additional 32 kt U (7007 PJ) was classified as Subeconomic Resources and 915 kt U (39 393 PJ) as Inferred Resources. Australia’s total Identified Resources are 2216 kt U (1 241 091 PJ). Although most Australian states and territories host uranium deposits, EDR are concentrated in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia (<u><a href=\"#id.6pdydg6creag\" >Figure 2</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.8pd31b4gv0bz\" >Figure 3</a></u>). South Australia’s Olympic Dam is the world’s largest uranium deposit, with EDR of 916 kt U (512 957 PJ). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Thorium is a naturally occurring, slightly radioactive metal, which is three to five times more abundant in the Earth’s crust than uranium. It is considered less conducive to nuclear weapons proliferation, and, as a result of its greater energy-producing efficiency, generates substantially less radioactive waste. The most common source of thorium is monazite, a rare earth phosphate mineral that is a minor constituent of heavy-mineral sand (HMS) deposits. On average, monazite contains approximately 6 per cent thorium and 60 per cent rare earth elements.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In Australia, approximately 70 per cent of thorium resources are contained in HMS deposits; the remaining 30 per cent are in rare earth element hard-rock deposits (<u><a href=\"#id.taekhsq4flpx\" >Figure 4</a></u>). Because monazite and thorium resources are not generally published, Geoscience Australia estimates the monazite (and hence thorium) content in deposits and classifies these estimated resources as Inferred Resources. Using this approach, Geoscience Australia estimates that Australia’s total <i>in situ</i> thorium resources were approximately 774 kt at December 2016.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Currently, no thorium is produced in Australia. Although HMS deposits containing monazite are currently being mined, the monazite is not recovered due to the lack of a thorium market.</p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency (OECD NEA and IAEA) describe 16 uranium deposit types.

Australia accounts for approximately 32 per cent of the global RAR of uranium recoverable at less than US$130/kg U (<u><a href=\"#id.imkhnht3rxlc\" >Figure 5</a></u>); approximately 1815 kt of Australia’s identified uranium resources are equivalent to the international RAR classification (<u><a href=\"#id.yafg6srv1k2x\" >Table 1</a></u>).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"5\"  id=\"id.yafg6srv1k2x\"><p >Table 1 Key uranium statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0;

\">Thorium resources can be grouped into four main types of deposits: placer (sand deposits), carbonatite-type (carbonate mineral-rich intrusives), vein-type and alkaline rock (OECD NEA and IAEA 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Placer-type deposits account for 35 per cent of world thorium resources. They occur as paleo-quartz pebble conglomerates in South Africa, and HMS deposits in Australia, Brazil, India, Mozambique, South Africa and the United States. Carbonatite-type deposits (29 per cent of world thorium resources) are found in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Russian Federation, Scandinavia, South Africa and the United States. Vein-type (25 per cent) and alkaline-rock (9 per cent) deposits are similarly widespread around the world.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Total world resources of <i>in situ</i> thorium are estimated to be 6.4 Mt. Australia has approximately 10 per cent of the world&#39;s identified thorium resources (<u><a href=\"#id.8woo83dz5qx5\" >Figure 6</a></u>).</p><h2 >Production</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is the world’s third largest uranium producer after Kazakhstan and Canada. In 2014–15, Australia’s production of uranium was approximately 6.50 kt U (3053 PJ; <u><a href=\"#id.9rk1jnnevbrp\" >Figure 7</a></u>). In 2017, Australia’s uranium production was from three operating uranium mines: Olympic Dam and Four Mile in South Australia, and Ranger in the Northern Territory (<u><a href=\"#id.1yteyont4hgc\" >Figure 8</a></u>). All of Australia’s domestic production is exported.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In South Australia, new mining is proposed at the Honeymoon project, and, in Western Australia, the Cameco Kintyre and Yeelirrie projects, Toro’s Wiluna project and Vimy’s Mulga Rock project have received environmental approval. Development of all these projects is contingent on market conditions.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian uranium supply has declined moderately during the past ten years as a result of the closure of two mines in 2014 and 2015. Moreover, production issues at Olympic Dam (in particular, from late 2009 into 2010) and at Ranger set production back considerably (World Nuclear Association 2017b). However, total Australian production increased by 9.2 per cent in 2014–15 compared with 2013–14. Reflecting Australia’s large and low-cost uranium reserves, Australian production of uranium may increase moderately in the medium term.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Global uranium production is focused in a small number of countries, with Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, Namibia and Niger accounting for most production. Proterozoic unconformity-related deposits in Canada dominate the categories of lowest production cost; the sandstone-hosted resources of Kazakhstan, Niger and the United States comprise the next cost level. The Australian Olympic Dam breccia complex deposit is dominant in the key cost category of less than US$130/kg U. </p><h2 >Consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia does not consume any of its locally produced uranium. A small amount of low-enriched uranium is imported for use at the Lucas Heights OPAL research reactor of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. The research reactor provides medical isotopes for nuclear medicine and treatment, scientific research and irradiation of industrial materials.</p><h2 >Investment</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">At December 2016, there were no uranium projects at the committed stage of development in Australia. However, a number of proposed projects are being progressed through investment and environmental approval processes in anticipation of improved international uranium market conditions (<u><a href=\"#id.1yteyont4hgc\" >Figure 8</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s uranium exploration expenditure has been declining substantially over time, mainly as a result of historically low prices. There was a 47 per cent decrease in 2016 to $23 million, mainly because of a $15 million decline in exploration expenditure in Western Australia. Exploration spending now stands at just over one-tenth of the 2010 peak, when it reached $190 million (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2017b).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Investment has also been limited because of bans on uranium exploration in many Australian states. Uranium exploration was legalised in New South Wales in 2012, and remains illegal in Victoria. </p><h2 >Trade</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is a preferred supplier, especially to east Asian markets, including China and the Republic of Korea, where demand has been growing rapidly (World Nuclear Association 2017b).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia exports all its uranium production to countries within its network of bilateral safeguards agreements, which ensures that the uranium is used only for peaceful purposes and does not contribute to any military applications. Since 2007, Australia has negotiated bilateral safeguards agreements for the export of uranium to China, India, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian mining companies supply uranium under long-term contracts to electricity utilities in Canada, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and the United States, as well as members of the European Union including France, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, Australia exported 2592 PJ (5.52 kt U), which was well down on the previous year. This reduction reflected subdued world demand for uranium and subsequent high levels of stocks held overseas in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">While Australian uranium producers have historically sold their production through secure long-term contracts, some Australian production is sold on the world spot market. Recently, an industry trend of indexing contract prices to spot prices has emerged; although most of Australia’s current long-term contracts do not have these provisions.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian producers may face tougher conditions in terms of uranium prices in the medium term and possibly longer, as their long-term supply contracts expire. For Australian producers that sell uranium on the spot market, the price is currently below the cost of production for most miners (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2017b).</p><h2 >Image gallery</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.6pdydg6creag\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

The production of uranium is quite volatile from year to year, but in the medium term the production of uranium in Australia is expected to increase moderately from recent lows. However, world uranium market conditions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and prices have been relatively subdued during the past year or so. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In volume terms, uranium represents approximately 16 per cent of total Australian energy exports. However, in value terms, uranium is only a small proportion of Australia’s energy exports.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The future development and use of Australia’s uranium resources will largely depend on global demand for nuclear power, and supply issues, including competition from other world producers and uranium prices.</p><h3 >Global demand growth</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Growth in world uranium consumption is driven by the development of new nuclear power generation capacity. Global consumption of uranium is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the medium term, after a decline following the Fukushima disaster, to meet the continued expansion of electricity generation from nuclear power. The International Energy Agency’s New Policies Scenario expects nuclear power to maintain its 11–12 per cent share of the global electricity generation mix until at least 2025 (International Energy Agency 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Uranium consumption is expected to be relatively flat in the European Union and the United States, as nuclear power must compete with renewables, and lower-cost coal- or gas-powered generation. Growth is expected in India, Russia and the rest of Asia, with very substantial growth expected over the next six years in China in response to a rapid expansion of nuclear power (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2017b).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">However, significant uncertainty underlies these forecasts. Countries such as China, India and the Republic of Korea must balance the need for a diversified energy portfolio with the cost competitiveness of nuclear against renewables, coal and gas. Restarting the currently mothballed nuclear reactors in Japan could have a major effect on the uranium outlook. In addition, public opposition to nuclear energy in a number of countries is limiting the growth of nuclear generation.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is expected to continue to be a major producer and exporter of uranium as a nuclear fuel to world markets for the foreseeable future, due to its large reserves and stable commercial environment. In addition, Australia has been a preferred uranium supplier historically, particularly to the east Asian markets, where growth in uranium demand has been the most rapid. </p><h3 >Supply issues</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Global supply of uranium is dominated by low-cost production from Kazakhstan, followed by Canada and then Australia. World uranium supply is expected to expand in the medium term, although year-to-year growth rates will depend on the depletion rate of the substantial uranium stockholdings held by nuclear utilities, and secondary market supplies where existing stocks are traded.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Moderate growth in supply is expected in Kazakhstan, Canada and Russia, provided that consumption expands as expected. Africa, including Namibia, is expected to show significant growth (Department of Industry, Innovation and Science 2017b). Production growth in the longer term will depend on the global demand for nuclear power, which is highly uncertain. For example, the International Energy Agency projects an annual growth in demand of 2.2 per cent from 2014 to 2030, and up to 4.0 per cent under various scenarios from 2014 to 2030 (International Energy Agency 2016). New projects may remain on hold given persistently low world uranium prices, until price increases improve their commercial viability.</p><h3 >Investment</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">It is expected that uranium producers will focus on cutting costs in the medium term, with higher-cost mines likely to scale back or close. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the medium term, there is potential for growth in Australia’s uranium industry, although uranium prices, and government policy and regulation in Australia will play an important role in determining the extent of this growth. Australia has no plans for a commercial nuclear power industry or enrichment facilities, and Australia’s uranium production will continue to be exported.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The viability of new uranium mines in Australia will depend in part on ore grade and type, but also on infrastructure requirements and economies of scale. Strong competition from low-cost producers such as Kazakhstan, that have benefited from improvements in technology and increased foreign investment, will continue to constrain the expansion of the Australian uranium industry.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. 2016<i>.</i> Australian Energy Statistics. <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Pages/Australian-energy-statistics.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Pages/Australian-energy-statistics.aspx</a> (last accessed 8 February 2018).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. 2017a.

Generally, temperature increases with depth in the Earth – this is the geothermal gradient. The temperature at the centre of the Earth is estimated to be more than 6000°C. Heat flows from hot to cold: the flow of heat from the centre of the Earth to the surface and into space is called ‘heat flow’.</li><li>Geothermal energy is abundant, one of the cleanest and most reliable sources of energy, with minimal wastes or pollutants, and virtually 100 per cent sustainable. Unlike most renewable resources, geothermal energy is not variable and does not require energy storage to provide a constant supply of electricity or heat.</li><li>Australian geothermal installations include many ground source heat pumps, numerous direct-use installations (e.g. heating large swimming pools), spas and one operating electricity generation plant at Birdsville. Most direct-use installations are in the Perth, Otway, Gippsland and Great Artesian basins. Most ground source heat pumps are installed in the colder parts of Australia.</li><li>The geothermal sector in Australia is still in the early stages of development. There has been no noticeable recent growth in electricity generation for Australia from this energy source.</li></ul><h2 >Summary</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geothermal energy has been used for millennia – for example, for bathing and cooking. Electricity generation, as well as the extraction of elements (such as boric acid) from geothermal brines, was pioneered in Larderello, Italy, more than 100 years ago. Electricity generation from geothermal energy is achieved via steam turbines. Technologies also exist to use geothermal heat for industrial or heating processes – these are collectively called direct-use technologies.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Worldwide, most geothermal electricity generation comes from volcanic regions that have very high heat flow due to the presence of shallow magma. Australia has no known active magmatism, and the heat source for Australia’s unconventional systems is a combination of radiogenic heat production from rocks in the upper crust and conducted heat from the mantle (<u><a href=\"#id.4rd7g3hjpel8\" >Figure 1</a></u>). An insulating layer of blanketing sediments is needed to allow heat to accumulate and high temperatures to be reached. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In addition to electricity generation, geothermal energy is used for direct-use applications (<u><a href=\"#id.g5bfy42t4lk7\" >Figure 2</a></u>) in industrial processes (e.g. drying, cooling) and for spas. Also, at depths of only metres beneath the land surface, the temperature is quite stable year-round, and a ground source heat pump (GSHP) can effectively heat and cool a building. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.4rd7g3hjpel8\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Most geothermal power stations access temperatures of &#62;160°C at depths of approximately 2 km beneath the surface. In most of Australia, those temperatures are not reached until depths of approximately 3 km. Australia’s geothermal resources are considered to be unconventional, and are classified as either an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) or a hot sedimentary aquifer (HSA).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The unconventional geothermal resource in Australia is considerable, occurring in locations where a number of key geological features intersect, including: </p><ul style=\"margin:0;\"><li>widespread occurrence of basement rocks, especially granites, with unusually high heat-generating capacities; </li><li>regions of anomalously elevated heat flow from the mantle beneath the upper crust; and</li><li>large sedimentary basins that are filled with thermally insulating sediments or volcanic rocks.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A successful geothermal system has two key properties: temperature, and the ability to pass enough water through hot rock to move enough heat energy to the surface to use commercially. Hot sedimentary aquifers are shallow (less than 3 km) and usually have good natural permeability, provided that the host basin has not been metamorphosed. Deeper, in the rocks beneath insulating sedimentary basins, the crystalline basement rocks have poor permeability. For these rocks to be able to flow water, they need to be fracture stimulated; these are called EGS. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Both EGS and HSA resources can be used for electricity generation or in direct-use applications.</p><h3 >Hot sedimentary aquifer resources</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The HSA resource in Australia could be substantial, as sedimentary basins with effective aquifers cover most of the Australian continent. However, only a few basins are known to have high enough geothermal gradients for higher-temperature HSA applications, including electricity generation. These include the Otway Basin (South Australia, Victoria), the Gippsland Basin (Victoria), the Perth Basin (Western Australia), the Carnarvon Basin (Western Australia) and the Great Artesian Basin (GAB; Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory). These basins have aquifers at shallow to moderate depths; however, their porosity and permeability for geothermal purposes have not been adequately tested. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Deep, high-temperature HSA resources have been drill tested in two locations. In the Otway Basin, Panax Geothermal Pty Ltd drilled Salamander 1, and, in the Cooper Basin, Geodynamics Pty Ltd drilled Celsius 1. Both wells measured good temperatures, but neither achieved sufficient water flow rates (Budd and Gerner 2015). Research indicated that careful mapping could identify where conditions of poor flow were less likely to occur (South Australian Centre for Geothermal Energy Research 2014), but no drilling has been conducted to test the research findings. It can be concluded that deep HSA reservoirs have not been adequately tested in Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Hot springs are the surface manifestation of an HSA resource (<u><a href=\"#id.z2u8plq9d0rw\" >Figure 3</a></u>). They are primarily used for bathing or hydronic heating in Australia. Australian hot springs are typically cooler than those in parts of the world with higher geothermal gradients, with temperatures generally not exceeding 50°C. This limits how they can be used in direct-use applications.</p><h3 >Enhanced geothermal system resources</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Compilations of the predicted temperature at 5 km depth suggest that there are substantial areas of the Australian continent where temperatures exceed 200°C at this depth, which is considered the temperature required for geothermal electricity generation to be technically feasible (<u><a href=\"#id.z2u8plq9d0rw\" >Figure 3</a></u>). This implies that Australia has world-class potential for unconventional geothermal energy resources. A simple calculation suggests that, if just 1 per cent of Australia’s geothermal energy above a minimum temperature of 150°C and at a maximum depth of 5 km were accessible and economically extractable, the total geothermal resource suitable for electricity generation is conservatively in the order of 190 million petajoules (PJ), which is roughly 25 000 times Australia’s primary annual energy use (Budd et al. 2008).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Deep, high-temperature EGS resources have been drill tested and hydraulically stimulated in two locations. In the Cooper Basin, Geodynamics Pty Ltd developed the Habanero project (see below), and, east of the Flinders Ranges, Petratherm Pty Ltd drilled Paralana 2. The Paralana project was not completed, as insufficient funds were available to drill a second well into the fractured reservoir. It can be concluded that deep EGS reservoirs have not been adequately tested in Australia.</p><h3 >Geoexchange and other heat exchange resources</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In geoexchange systems (also known as GSHPs), the Earth acts as a heat source or a heat sink exploiting the temperature difference between the surface (atmosphere) and at depth. The temperature of the Earth just a few metres below the surface is much more consistent than atmospheric temperature, especially in seasonal climates. These resources do not need addition of geothermal heat.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">To make use of this stable subsurface temperature, water or another fluid is pumped through pipes into the ground to change the temperature of the circulating fluid. The optimal-temperature fluid is transported back to the surface to a heat exchanger (water–air loop, such as a reverse-cycle air-conditioning system). In some cases, groundwater is used (i.e. an open system) rather than a closed-loop pipe system.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Other substrates can also be used as heat exchangers, including water bodies or waste products. Examples of systems in use are the Sydney Opera House (using Sydney Harbour as a water-loop heat exchanger) and Sandown Village in Tasmania (using stored effluent as a heat exchanger).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">These systems can be installed anywhere in Australia – the limitation is economic in that the installations must be sized to match the building’s heating and cooling load with the available thermal difference between the atmosphere and the ground or other heat sink/source. </p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geothermal resources globally are widespread and complex, with many different types of systems. Global geothermal resource estimates of the accessible electrical potential range from 35 gigawatts (GW) to 200 GW (World Energy Council 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Most of the world’s high-temperature geothermal fields (&#62;180°C) are convective hydrothermal systems with a magmatic heat source. These igneous systems include vapour (steam)-dominated fields, such as Kamojang (Indonesia) and Larderello (Italy), as well as liquid-dominated reservoirs that are prevalent in New Zealand, Iceland, Kenya, the Philippines and Japan. Intermediate-temperature resources (101–180°C) associated with convective geothermal systems resulting from high rates of crustal extension include the Basin and Range province in the western United States, and Western Anatolia in Turkey (World Energy Council 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Conductive systems, where relatively high heat flow and insulation combine to create anomalously hot rock, typically provide low-temperature (30–100°C) to intermediate-temperature geothermal resources. In other configurations (HSAs), conductive heat may be transferred to circulating groundwater, creating artesian warm springs such as Bath (Great Britain) or regional aquifers such as the Malm Limestone in Europe. In rapidly subsiding sedimentary basins, over-pressured mudstones caused by rapid sedimentation may create thermal blankets that trap conductive heat in strata (geopressured aquifers), such as the East Java (Porong) Sub-basin in Indonesia (World Energy Council 2016).</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><h3 >Electricity generation</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">To date, three geothermal energy projects have demonstrated geothermal electricity generation technologies in Australia. In 1986, Mulka Station in South Australia used a hot artesian bore penetrating the GAB to produce a maximum 0.02 MW of electricity. However, because the binary power plant used a working fluid that was later banned, it ceased operation after three and a half years (Burns et al. 2000). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In May 2013, a pilot plant was successfully commissioned at the Innamincka Deeps Project in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The 1 MW plant produced Australia’s first electricity generated from an EGS resource and ran for five months (Geodynamics 2014). At the time, it was the world’s most productive EGS installation. The pilot plant was the last stage of a ten-year project that found that, although geothermal heat could be used to generate electricity at a lower cost than diesel generation, there was insufficient demand in the remote Innamincka area. The study also found that the heat could be used for processing natural gas if certain conditions were met. However, the gas industry did not develop near the identified geothermal resource in 2014–16, and so this capability was not developed further.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The only currently operating geothermal power plant, with a total capacity of 0.12 MW gross, is operated by Ergon Energy in Birdsville, Queensland. This power plant is a hybrid diesel–Organic Rankine Cycle plant. It sources hot (98°C) waters at relatively shallow depths from the GAB. </p><h3 >Direct-use technologies</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Large-scale direct-use HSA systems, such as those used to heat swimming pools or provide hydronic heating systems and commercial-scale geoexchange systems are steadily increasing in number in Australia. In 2016, six commercial-scale systems were installed (<u><a href=\"#id.bsyq711hveys\" >Table 1</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Other examples of direct-use geothermal systems include Robarra (Robe, South Australia) and Mainstream Aquaculture (Werribee, Victoria), both growing barramundi; Midfield Meats (Warrnambool, Victoria), which uses hot bore water for washing and sterilising; and the Quality Suites Deep Blue spa resort (Warrnambool, Victoria) and Peninsula Hot Springs spa (Fingal, Victoria), which both use geothermal water (Beardsmore et al. 2015).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The use of geoexchange technology at scale in housing developments and other large commercial applications is becoming increasingly common. The Geoscience Australia building in Canberra, the Fairwater Estate GSHP system, and the 72 MW<sub>th</sub> (megawatts thermal) Barangaroo water-loop heat rejection cooling system are examples.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geoscience Australia has attempted to estimate the installed capacity of direct-use geothermal and geoexchange systems in Australia, including large-scale GSHP and HSA applications through to December 2016 (<u><a href=\"#id.xny649r7pxj\" >Figure 4</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.u16xcx29im4k\" >Figure 5</a></u>; <u><a href=\"#id.bsyq711hveys\" >Table 1</a></u>). As this industry has grown without the benefit of government subsidies and with no governing standards association, there are no specific reporting requirements for these projects. Instead, publicly sourced data and <i>ad hoc</i> data from industry have been used.

Since there is currently no trade in geothermal energy due to logistical barriers, Australia’s production and consumption of geothermal energy are equal. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The geothermal sector in Australia is still in the early stages of development and has experienced no noticeable growth in electricity generation in the past decade. In 2014–15, 0.6 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was generated from geothermal sources, accounting for only a very small share of the country&#39;s total renewable generation. Total electricity generation for the Birdsville power plant in 2006 was 1.8 megawatt hours (MWh), of which 0.5 MWh was provided by the geothermal power plant. The remainder was provided by three 300 kW diesel-powered generators (Ergon Energy 2009). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014, geothermal energy accounted for approximately 0.5 per cent of the world’s primary energy consumption. Geothermal energy provides only 0.3 per cent of total electricity generation; it struggles to compete on price with other energy resources (<u><a href=\"#id.mq8r5akvo19n\" >Table 2</a></u>). Geographically, 72 per cent of installed generation capacity globally resides along tectonic plate boundaries or ‘hot spot’ features of the Pacific Rim. All of these are igneous convective resources. In contrast, only 20 per cent of total installed generation capacity resides in convection fields situated along spreading centres and convergent margins within the Atlantic Basin. A disproportionate percentage of installed generation capacity globally resides in island nations or regions (43 per cent). Virtually all these resources occupy positions either at the junction of tectonic plates (such as Iceland) or within a ‘hot spot’ (e.g. Hawaii; World Energy Council 2016). Technological improvements have made it possible for most countries to use shallow low-temperature geothermal resources in addition to higher-temperature resources. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">With an installed capacity of 1.1 megawatts electrical (MW<sub>e</sub>), Australia is significantly behind the top ten geothermal electricity–generating countries (Bertani 2015; <u><a href=\"#id.tq9krk6y5fwc\" >Table 3</a></u>). This figure includes the 1 MW<sub>e</sub> Habanero Pilot Plant, which was decommissioned in 2015. In recent years, Turkey, followed by the United States, Mexico, Kenya, Japan and Germany, have been undergoing the fastest growth in the geothermal electricity generation sector (World Energy Council 2016).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"  id=\"id.mq8r5akvo19n\"><p >Table 2 Key geothermal energy statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p >Unit</p></td><td><p >Australia 2014–15<sup>a</sup></p></td><td><p >Australia 2015</p></td><td><p >OECD 2015</p></td><td><p >OECD 2014</p></td><td><p >World 2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p ><strong>Primary energy consumption</strong></p></td><td><p >PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.04</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">1467</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">1399</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">2986</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Share of total</p></td><td><p >%</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.00</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.84</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.81</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.52</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >CAGR from 2000</p></td><td><p >%</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.94</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.67</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">2.26</p></td></tr><tr><td><p ><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p >Electricity output</p></td><td><p >TWh</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.0006</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.001</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">50</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">48</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">77</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Share of total</p></td><td><p >%</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.00024</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.0004</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.47</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.45</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">0.32</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >CAGR from 2000 </p></td><td><p >%</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">2.84</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">2.77</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">2.88</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Electricity capacity</p></td><td><p >GW</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">6.704</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: right;\">na</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\" ><p >a.

The operator of the Birdsville HSA geothermal power plant, Ergon Energy, has investigated an expansion project to increase Birdsville’s output to 0.2 MW to further reduce Birdsville’s reliance on diesel generators. The expansion could provide up to 70 per cent of the town’s electricity requirements and reduce fuel bills by $340 000 per year (Wardill 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Queensland Local Government Infrastructure Services is working with nine councils in north, central and south-western Queensland to develop geothermal power plants that will provide electricity to council assets in 12 towns; a further nine councils are considering joining the program. This geothermal energy program is very similar to that of Birdsville, with an Organic Rankine Cycle power plant to use hot water from bores drilled into GAB aquifers to generate electricity. For many Queensland towns, the town water supply is GAB bore water, which must be cooled before it is reticulated to users. Rather than waste the heat energy contained by the water, geothermal power plants can use the heat to generate electricity for the town, without affecting the town water supply (Local Government Infrastructure Services 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The first council in the program, Winton Shire Council, is planning to construct a 310 kW geothermal power plant to provide electricity for the council’s main assets in Winton, with a total annual consumption of approximately 1500 MWh. Construction of the plant is scheduled to begin in mid-2017. A possible expansion of the Winton geothermal energy project to include a combined geothermal, solar and battery plant – which could provide sufficient energy for a community of 2000 residents and future businesses in and around the town – has been discussed. If this model was applied in 11 other Queensland towns, it could result in an installed capacity approaching 100 MW (Local Government Infrastructure Services 2016).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The use of geoexchange technology at scale in housing developments and other large commercial applications is continuing to grow.

In particular, unlike most renewable technologies, geothermal is not variable and does not require energy storage. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Using the geothermal resource also presents a number of challenges. The failure of deep geothermal for electricity generation in Australia despite more than $900 million investment since 1990 (Australian Renewable Energy Agency 2014) has been discussed by Budd and Gerner (2015). More promisingly, installations exploiting shallower and lower-temperature HSA geothermal and geoexchange resources are increasing in number. Ground source heat pumps and other direct-use or geoexchange technologies have been installed without any financial assistance from government, unlike solar hot water systems, which also act as energy consumption offsets (i.e. do not provide electricity but reduce electricity or gas consumption). Large projects such as Fairwater Estate may help to lower future installation costs of these systems by establishing a supply chain, including installation and maintenance skills and experience.</p><h3 >Factors influencing development</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geothermal resources are used <i>in situ</i>; hot water cannot be piped far without losing heat. Of course, powerlines can carry electricity significant distances with low line losses. Mapping of geothermal resources and matching them to a potential energy use (e.g. direct use, electricity on- or off-grid) is an important precursor to development. Doing this effectively is a key component of reducing investment risk and costs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The commercial development of the EGS electricity industry would require the demonstration of a pathway to commercial readiness in Australia. Despite nearly 40 years of investigation worldwide, EGS electricity generation has not been commercially realised other than at small scale (&#60;10 MW). Enhanced geothermal systems remain a high-risk proposition, with uncertainty around the ability to produce water of sufficient flow rates and temperature. A study commissioned by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA; Australian Renewable Energy Agency 2014) examined these issues in detail. It recognised that geothermal energy has a unique combination of advantages of high availability and low environmental impact, but that there are major barriers to commercialisation. All the required technologies exist (e.g. drilling deep wells, fracturing rocks, energy conversion), but they need to be made to work together in a repeatable manner and at lower cost.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although geothermal energy is generally regarded as one of the most environmentally benign sources of electricity generation, some negative perceptions are still associated with geothermal resource development. These include concerns over competing land uses (although geothermal has a lower footprint area than equivalent energy production areas for wind or solar) and the perceived risks associated with the hydraulic stimulation required to develop deep geothermal resources – for example, aquifer contamination and over-exploitation, subsidence, and induced seismicity. Managing public perception and minimising risk will be key issues in any future geothermal industry development. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Direct-use technologies have already been demonstrated to be economically and environmentally beneficial in numerous installations around Australia. In the direct-use sector, standards similar to those for other building components would increase purchaser confidence, as would further study into the financial benefits of such systems. The development of a larger supply chain will reduce costs, as was emphatically seen with the rollout of rooftop solar photovoltaics.</p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The cost competitiveness of geothermal energy in the electricity generation sector has been demonstrated in off-grid areas such as at Birdsville, but not in grid-connected areas. Also, systems using geothermal energy for heating and cooling to displace electricity or gas have been demonstrated to be cost competitive (e.g. GSHPs, swimming pool heating). Geoexchange systems are more energy efficient than air-source heat pumps, which offsets the higher installation costs (Lu et al. 2017).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The relative immaturity of geothermal electricity generation in Australia means that it is not cost competitive with other generation technologies, with some exceptions. Currently, as illustrated by <u><a href=\"#id.ynkvujoqoh8c\" >Figure 6</a></u>, initial pre-survey exploration and test drilling stages in the life cycle of a geothermal project contain high project risks and potentially costs. The risks and associated costs will be mitigated by improved geological understanding of how these resources work, and improved technology for exploration and drilling. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In the life cycle of a geothermal project costs typically rise significantly after the feasibility studies stage. Upfront costs, for well drilling and plant construction, are the biggest contributors to the overall capital costs of geothermal energy generation, depending on the technology. Improving technologies for energy conversion, including for power plant cooling in arid terrains, will reduce these costs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">With very little research and development work now being undertaken on deep geothermal in Australia, we will be dependent on cost breakthroughs in other countries if deep geothermal is ever to gain a foothold. As a member of the <u><a href=\"http://ipgtgeothermal.org\" target=\"_blank\">International Partnership for Geothermal Technology</a></u>, Australia will be aware of any such developments as they occur. The significant cost advantage for geothermal is that, unlike other renewable resources, energy storage is not needed to overcome supply variability. However the continuing cost reductions for technologies such as solar and batteries, and the relative ease of deploying these technologies may negate this advantage.</p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The geothermal sector in Australia is at the early stage of the innovation cycle, with low levels of commercial readiness. Before the collapse of the developing industry, most electricity generation projects ranged from early-stage exploration to feasibility studies. These operations found it difficult to attract funding from institutional investors and government due to the lack of proven demonstration projects and finance experience with the technology in Australia. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As described above, the biggest technological challenge for geothermal energy is improving exploration tools to reduce uncertainty associated with test drilling. Two key mechanisms by which improving technology in the geothermal sector can improve exploration, development and installation outcomes are: improving the efficiency of energy conversion; and increasing understanding of, and maximising, zones of fluid flow, including finding these zones efficiently.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Improving the efficiency of energy conversion of geothermal resources (both electricity generation and direct-use applications) directly affects the cost of installation (i.e. smaller plant for same output) or the size of the available resource base (i.e. lower-temperature resources can be used commercially). In the near term, improvements in energy efficiency could allow the exploitation of shallower (and hence less expensive) HSA electricity generation possibilities and improve the cost effectiveness of direct-use applications. Technology improvements affecting conversion efficiency include improved turbines and power plant cooling systems.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Fluid flow is crucial to all types of geothermal resources – injected fluid in a deep EGS system or the flow of hot water through an HSA system – because the fluid is the transport medium for heat. Fluid flow in rocks occurs either through connected pore spaces (i.e. primary permeability, often found in sandstones), or in fractures or pore spaces that have occurred after rock formation (i.e. secondary permeability). The amount of heat energy delivered to the surface is dependent on both fluid temperature and fluid flow rate.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Drilling is one of the biggest costs of geothermal installations. Improving exploration drilling success rates, and increasing production and injection well productivity will lower the cost of geothermal energy production. Key areas in which improving the state of knowledge about fluid flow parameters will improve exploration success and well productivity are as follows:</p><ul style=\"margin:0;\"><li>Better prediction of fluid flow paths ahead of drilling; this can be achieved for HSA resources through basin burial and metamorphic/deformation history studies so that predictions can be made about the preservation of primary permeability, particularly in sandstones.</li><li>In EGS systems, the detection and prediction of existing fractures; this is currently an area of active research in 3D geophysical methods such as seismic attribute analysis and magnetotelluric surveys, as well as predictive Mechanical Earth Models.</li><li>Improved fracture stimulation methods, incorporating holistic analysis of thermal, hydraulic, mechanical and chemical properties.</li><li>Using petroleum drilling technologies to reduce per-well drilling costs, and improving per-well productivity (hence lowering the number of wells needed to be drilled).</li></ul><br /><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Geothermal research in Australia is continuing with two active research projects. At Monash University, geothermal research is seeking to understand the efficiencies and performance of various types of geoexchange technology. A $450 000 ARENA-funded project at the University of Adelaide is investigating and compiling national-scale fracture and subsurface permeability data.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Since a litre of hot water delivered to the surface has much lower value than the same volume of petroleum or a solution carrying a dissolved metal, the technologies to improve geothermal energy use are most likely to come from these currently more profitable industries.</p><h3 >Other challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">An impediment to the development of some of Australia’s geothermal resources for electricity generation is the distance of resources from existing transmission lines or consumption centres. Geothermal plants are built at the site of the resource since it is not practical to transport hot water over long distances. Additional transmission lines must be built if transmission infrastructure does not exist where the geothermal resource is located. As geothermal developments are generally in remote locations and are grown in increments of a few megawatts, with each additional producer progressively adding capacity, they are potentially well suited to supplying electricity off-grid. With further cost reductions, geothermal may potentially provide a cost-effective alternative to diesel-fuelled generation.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Development of deep EGS electricity projects will require drilling and hydraulic stimulation activities. In other industries, these activities are subject to significant community concerns in many parts of Australia. Community consultation will be an important part of any future deep EGS geothermal projects in Australia.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian Renewable Energy Agency. 2014.

Water released from an elevated position turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator. The amount of energy that can be extracted from water flows depends on the volume of flow and the height difference between the flow source and the point of generation. Australia’s largest hydroelectric generators are comparable in generation capacity with those of the nation’s largest coal-fired generators, although few new sites are available at this scale. However, existing sites could be upgraded to provide additional pumped storage capacity. Future hydro projects using smaller off-river sites could potentially provide decentralised local energy storage.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.b4r9s2gzser\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

The vast majority of Australia’s current hydroelectricity generation capacity and reservoir storage is in south-eastern Australia. While New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have extensive hydroelectricity installations, the remaining states and territories have minimal hydroelectricity capacity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although reservoirs provide significant storage capacity, the availability of water resources is subject to seasonal variability. All major hydroelectricity schemes in Australia are subject to variations in water availability and demand for generation supply on differing time-scales. Annual variations reflect seasonal patterns in rainfall, but variability also occurs over longer time frames, reflecting shifts in weather and climate. Extended periods of low rainfall and drought can contribute to an overall depletion of available water in storage over multiple annual cycles. Climate events such as the negative Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño – Southern Oscillation can have significant impacts on storage levels when they persist for extended periods. Extended droughts can also affect other generators that rely on water storage for power cycle cooling.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Management of hydroelectricity schemes must take into account the expected fluctuations in storage levels that reflect the seasonality of rainfall across the catchment area. In south-eastern Australia, water stored in reservoirs is drawn upon in summer months and replenished in winter months when rain, and in some areas snow, precipitate. Some river systems have a requirement to maintain environmental water flows, and some are also used for irrigation. These fluctuations can result in seasonal intermittency – for example, during wet winter months, Hydro Tasmania is generally a net exporter of electricity to the National Energy Market (NEM), whereas, in dry summers when the water storages are lower, Hydro Tasmania is generally a net importer from the NEM.</p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Worldwide, hydroelectricity continues to be a major source of electricity. The role of hydroelectricity and pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) is a critical factor in the development of hydroelectricity resources. Pumped hydroelectric energy storage remains the primary technology used to provide energy storage services at the grid scale, comprising more than 95 per cent of storage capacity. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that 150 gigawatts (GW) of battery storage and 325 GW of PHES are required to double the share of renewable electricity generation by 2030 (International Renewable Energy Agency 2015). Interconnection between countries with hydro resources is playing a critical role in balancing variable renewable generation (e.g. Denmark and Norway), which is expected to grow in the coming decades. Discussions are underway among major energy companies in China, Japan, Russia and the Republic of Korea on the creation of an ‘Asian Super Grid’, in which an ultra-high-voltage grid would interconnect the region to transmit electricity generated from an abundance of clean, renewable sources such as hydro (International Hydropower Association 2017).</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at August 2016, Australia had more than 100 operating hydroelectric power stations with total installed capacity of 8018 megawatts (MW; <u><a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd1415a/15bd119\" target=\"_blank\">Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015</a></u>; <u><a href=\"#id.b4r9s2gzser\" >Figure 1</a></u>). These are located in the areas of highest rainfall and elevation, mostly in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. The <u><a href=\"https://www.snowyhydro.com.au/our-energy/hydro/the-scheme\" target=\"_blank\">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a></u>, with 16 major dams; nine power stations, two pumping stations; 225 km of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts; and a capacity of 4100 MW, is Australia&#39;s largest hydroelectricity scheme. It accounts for approximately half of Australia&#39;s total hydroelectricity generation capacity, and provides base load and peak load electricity to the eastern mainland grid of Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Tasmanian integrated hydroelectricity scheme harnesses hydro energy from six major water catchments, and involves 55 major dams, numerous lakes and 30 power stations, with a total capacity of more than 2280 MW. The scheme provides base and peak load electricity to the NEM, firstly to Tasmania and then to the Australian network through the Basslink interconnector, which runs under Bass Strait. Hydroelectricity schemes also operate in north-east Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, and there is a mini-hydroelectricity project in South Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">From late 2015 to mid-2016, Tasmania suffered an extended period of low storage levels in its hydroelectric dams. Multiple factors contributed to the potential shortage of available water for electricity generation; in particular, consecutive years of lower than average winter rainfall left dam storages under-replenished. This challenge was compounded by the loss of electricity transfers through the Basslink interconnector and the loss of backup supply within Tasmania. The situation was mitigated through reduced electricity consumption by industrial users and the introduction of backup supply from diesel generators. Following winter rainfalls consistent with normal patterns, dam storage levels in Tasmania returned to normal in 2016 (Clean Energy Council 2016; <u><a href=\"#id.e7r5r8hxlf5k\" >Figure 2</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.e7r5r8hxlf5k\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

From 2000–01 to 2014–15, hydroelectricity generation fluctuated during periods of below- or above-average rainfall. Over the same period, hydro’s share of total generation from renewables fell dramatically compared with the modest fall in its share of total electricity generation, because of the rapid growth in solar photovoltaics and wind power.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Tasmania generates the highest amount of hydroelectricity nationally, accounting for 62 per cent of total hydroelectricity generation in 2014–15. New South Wales accounted for 23 per cent of total hydroelectricity generation in 2014–15, sourced mostly from the Snowy Mountains Scheme.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s primary energy production and consumption of hydro energy fell by 27 per cent from 2013–14 to 48.4 PJ in 2014–15 due to lower than average rainfall. Hydro energy accounted for 0.8 per cent of primary energy consumption in 2014–15 and 14 per cent of all renewable energy used.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In Australia and other counties in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) where hydro is a mature technology, hydroelectricity consumption has remained flat since 2000. Conversely, world consumption has, on average, increased by nearly 3 per cent per year on the back of strong consumption growth (4.8 per cent) in non-OECD countries as they start to realise their hydroelectric generation potential. Australia has few large rivers with significant elevation change and limited sites available for large-scale hydroelectric schemes. Hence, Australia’s hydroelectricity generation as a share of total generation is lower than in other OECD countries and the rest of the world (<u><a href=\"#id.3p5c167u971i\" >Table 1</a></u>).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"  id=\"id.3p5c167u971i\"><p >Table 1 Key hydroelectricity statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Unit</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia 2014–15<sup>a</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2014</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">World 2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Primary energy consumption</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">48</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">50</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4953</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">5044</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">14 023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.82</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.31</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.84</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.91</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.43</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">CAGR from 2000</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">-1.11</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">-1.15</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.18</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.32</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.87</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity output</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">TWh</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">13</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">14</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1376</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1401</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">3895</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">5.33</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">5.54</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">12.78</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">12.99</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">16.35</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity capacity</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">GW</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">472</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\" ><p >a.

However, there are opportunities to use PHES technology. Genex Power Limited has proposed transforming two adjacent pits from the disused Kidston gold mine into a 250 MW large-scale hydroelectric power plant that could supply a daily maximum of 1500 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity to the grid. The plant could potentially store excess electricity generation from a proposed 270 MW large-scale solar farm to be built adjacent to the proposed PHES site and then sell it directly into the NEM during times of peak demand.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In March 2017, the Australian Government announced its intention to facilitate increased pumped hydro capacity in Australia. This would include a proposed 50 per cent expansion of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, adding 2000 MW of generation capacity to provide 350,000 MWh of energy storage. The government, through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, will examine several sites that could support large-scale PHES in the precinct. These sites would involve new tunnels and power stations connecting existing storages. The <u><a href=\"http://www.snowyhydro.com.au/our-scheme/snowy20/snowy-2-0-feasibility-study/\" target=\"_blank\">Snowy 2.0 Feasibility Study</a></u> was completed in December 2017. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Australian Government has also started working with the Tasmanian Government to assess options for new PHES schemes and to expand existing hydro power stations. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency will work with Hydro Tasmania on projects that could deliver up to 2500 MW of storage capacity, as well as examining expansion of the Tarraleah and Gordon power stations. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is also working with Hydro Tasmania on a ‘big picture view’ of how this PHES capacity could be used to help balance wind generation in Victoria and Tasmania.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The potential for any future PHES projects will be heavily influenced by the outcomes of the feasibility studies recently announced by the Australian Government and any subsequent investment in the expansion of these schemes. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Future development in the hydro sector is also likely to come from refurbishment and efficiency improvements at existing hydroelectricity plants, continued growth of small-scale hydroelectricity plants connected to the grid, and system balancing through the use of off-river and PHES systems.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There is also potential for pumped seawater projects in the future; however, this technology is in the development stage and is yet to be widely demonstrated internationally. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is supporting a study examining the feasibility of a 100 MW plant at Cultana on South Australia’s upper Spencer Gulf.</p><h2 >Outlook</h2><p >Hydro technology has the potential to be used for off-river storage of energy generated from variable renewable energy sources. The use of dams and water storage reservoirs for pumped storage schemes represents a significant opportunity. The extent of these projects will depend on the economics of pumped storage relative to other energy storage technologies and the availability of suitable sites.</p><p >Hydroelectricity can play an important role in maintaining a reliable electricity supply across the energy system, complementing the supply of electricity from variable sources such as wind and solar. Hydroelectric power stations can rapidly increase or decrease output with very short notice. Additionally, hydroelectricity generators can provide essential ancillary services to the NEM, such as voltage and frequency control, to maintain overall grid stability.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Future growth of conventional gravity-fed hydroelectricity generation will be influenced by water availability and competition for scarce water resources. As most of Australia’s best large-scale hydro energy opportunities have already been realised, there are limited opportunities for new large-scale hydro generation projects. However, the capacity of existing schemes could be expanded through various upgrades (including pumped storage). Significant opportunities exist for new and expanded off-river and pumped hydro generation, particularly given the potential to use PHES to balance variable renewable electricity sources such as wind and solar PV. </p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Pumped hydroelectric energy storage has the potential to provide price and supply reliability in the electricity market. The aim of PHES is to supply electricity when demand is high, as well as take advantage of differences in the spot price for electricity at different points in time. Because the round-trip efficiency for energy stored through PHES is relatively high (approximately 80 per cent), it is possible for operators to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that exist between lower, off-peak, spot prices for electricity and higher prevailing prices during periods of higher electricity demand. By providing a highly responsive supply of electricity during periods of peak electricity demand, PHES can help prevent reliance on more expensive sources of ‘peaking’ generation and avoid significant spikes in wholesale electricity prices.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">It is becoming more common to use smaller hydroelectric generation schemes to generate electricity from sources of lower flow and lower head pressure. These ‘mini-hydro’ plants installed on rivers and streams are becoming increasingly viable because of their lower development costs, water requirements and environmental footprints. Although these plants are significantly smaller, issues such as competing water use and algal blooms will need to be managed.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Clean Energy Council. 2016.

The sun is by far the major contributor of thermal energy. The Earth’s atmospheric circulation varies seasonally, but the large-scale structure remains fairly constant.</li><li>Australia has some of the world’s best wind resources along its south-western, southern and south-eastern margins, as well as along areas of the Great Dividing Range in eastern Australia and throughout Tasmania.</li><li>Between 2000–01 and 2014–15, electricity generation from wind increased from 0.2 TWh to 11.0 TWh in Australia. South Australia reached 50 per cent of total electricity generation from wind during 2018.</li><li>Wind is now one of the least expensive electricity generation technologies in Australia.</li></ul><h2 >Summary</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in wind into electricity via a generator. Most deployment of wind energy in Australia has been through large-scale wind farms grouping a number of large turbines together. The combination of cost reductions realised by a global supply chain, Australia’s excellent wind resources that are relatively close to existing transmission infrastructure and government incentives have driven widespread uptake. Deployment is also providing remote off-grid electricity, particularly for coastal and island communities, reducing exposure to high diesel prices and the need to transport diesel large distances. Offshore wind generation is yet to be developed in Australia due to a combination of cost, ocean depth and the availability of onshore sites, but is being investigated. There is potential for wind-derived energy to produce hydrogen via electrolysis in the medium to long term.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The predominant wind turbine technology in Australia uses the horizontal-axis design, in which two or three blades operate upwind with the blades facing the wind. Turbines have become bigger as well as smarter over the past decade. Sensors and software constantly monitor forces exerted on the blades; this can increase the amount of electricity generated and reduce the cost of wind power.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">While wind energy is a variable resource, when coupled with storage technologies it can provide reliable, dispatchable electricity to meet peak demand and balance the electricity system. Wind energy can complement the daily profile of solar with a more even statistical distribution through time and across locations. The pace of future wind technology deployment will depend on the ability to integrate wind generation into the energy mix, affordable access to the transmission network, policy incentives and the availability of cost-effective flexible capacity, such as storage including pumped hydro or large-scale batteries.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.8zbyscc0h8bk\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Areas with average wind speeds of 9 m/s or greater are regarded as areas with high wind resources (<u><a href=\"#id.8zbyscc0h8bk\" >Figure 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.yn3sfa8sm2o\" >Figure 2</a></u>). Resource potential is influenced by a combination of climatic conditions and local topography (<u><a href=\"#id.1ua41jibtlea\" >Figure 3</a></u>). Lesser resources may also be economic to exploit if they are more accessible and closer to the grid.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Good offshore wind resource sites are located off the coasts of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Ocean water depth increases rapidly around most of the Australian coastline, so the development of offshore sites is likely to be relatively high cost (Geoscience Australia and BREE 2014). An exception to this is offshore Gippsland in Victoria where water depths are less than 50 m at distances approximately 3 km offshore.</p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The windiest areas globally are typically coastal regions of continents at mid- to high-latitudes, and mountainous regions (<u><a href=\"#id.bk5uzf2rtc87\" >Figure 4</a></u>). Locations with the highest wind energy potential include the westerly wind belts between latitudes 35° and 50°. These include the coastal regions of western and southern Australia, New Zealand, southern South America, South Africa, northern and western Europe, and the north-eastern and western coasts of Canada and the United States. These regions are generally characterised by high, relatively constant wind conditions with average wind speeds of more than 6 m/s and, in places, more than 9 m/s.</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In general, the distribution of installed wind generation capacity in Australia mirrors that of the 7–8 m/s (on average) wind resource in locations such as South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. A significant proportion of Australia’s wind energy deployment has occurred in South Australia and Victoria due to their high wind resource potential, and favourable national and state government renewable energy policies (<u><a href=\"#id.5psgw28d674d\" >Figure 5</a></u>). South Australia currently has one of the highest penetrations of wind energy generation in any liberalised energy-only market: wind accounted for 50 per cent of total electricity generated in the nine months to 31 March 2017 (Australian Energy Regulator 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at 31 December 2017, Australia’s total large scale wind electricity generation capacity was approximately 4980 MW (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2018a). Approximately 4000 MW of this capacity was located in either South Australia, Victoria or Tasmania. There are now over 70 wind farms in Australia. There has been a surge in investment in recent times, with almost 2.5 GW of large-scale wind generation under construction during 2018 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2018b).</p><h2 >Production and consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s primary wind energy consumption rose by 12 per cent from 2013–14 to 2014–15, to 41.3 petajoules (PJ; <u><a href=\"#id.d0zwdlfnzdqz\" >Table 1</a></u>). This increase is likely due to support from state and territory–based renewable energy schemes and the national Renewable Energy Target. Wind energy accounted for 0.7 per cent of primary energy consumption in 2014–15 and 12 per cent of all renewable energy use.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation from wind energy has increased rapidly from a low base in recent years, reflecting the transition to a low carbon economy and the status of wind as one of the lowest-cost new-build large-scale electricity generation technologies. From 2000–01 to 2014–15, electricity generation from wind grew at an average rate of 33.1 per cent a year, from 0.2 terawatt hours (TWh) to 11.5 TWh (<u><a href=\"#id.bi611cwpzt5b\" >Figure 6</a></u>). Despite these increases, wind generation remains a small contributor to Australia’s total electricity generation, at 4.5 per cent in 2014–15. The share of wind in the electricity generation mix is expected to increase in the next few years as recent investments in capacity take effect.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, South Australia generated the highest amount of electricity from wind nationally. However, electricity generation from wind is growing throughout Australia. Since 2008–09, all other states except Queensland have grown at a faster rate than South Australia (<u><a href=\"#id.xy4t0oi6odpi\" >Figure 7</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The use of wind energy is currently on a smaller scale in Australia than in other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, it has recently experienced faster growth than in other OECD countries, albeit from a low base. </p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"  id=\"id.d0zwdlfnzdqz\"><p >Table 1 Key wind energy statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Unit</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia<sup> </sup>2014–15<sup>a</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2014</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">World 2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Primary energy consumption</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">41</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">39</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2037</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1756</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2583</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.70</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.25</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.17</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.01</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.45</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">CAGR from 2000<sup>b</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">42.73</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">41.71</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">22.04</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">22.48</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">25.06</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity output</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">TWh</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">11</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">11</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">566</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">488</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">717</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.54</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.36</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">5.26</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.52</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">3.01</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity capacity</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">GW</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">213.92</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\" ><p >a.

Wind is set to play an increasingly important role in Australia’s future energy mix, supported by incentives such as the national Renewable Energy Target. However, as the penetration of wind generation increases, managing transmission congestion, the variable nature of the resource and ensuring smooth integration into the grid will be the key challenges in the ongoing development of wind energy. Overcoming community concerns about wind farm proposals will also play a role in future development.</p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Wind energy is capital-intensive, involving large up-front costs for turbine and grid integration infrastructure. However, with low operation and maintenance costs, wind energy is the lowest-cost renewable technology that can be rolled out on a large scale. It is also becoming competitive with non-renewable technologies on a ‘cost per megawatt hour of energy generated’ basis and is clearly the cheapest new-build generation. As a variable source of generation, and being less predictable than solar, wind energy can be less valuable than other forms of generation depending on the cost of flexible capacity and the extent to which geographic diversity can help offset variability.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Existing Australian wind installations have tended to be located close to existing transmission lines and on reasonably accessible terrain. Consequently, costs tend to be lowest for wind energy projects in these areas. Other areas with higher average wind speeds are generally more remote, presenting deployment challenges and less access to the energy market. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Access to transmission lines will be a key factor in exploiting wind resources in the future. As the areas for further development that are close to existing transmission lines decrease, new transmission capacity will be needed. A significant challenge in this regard is coordinating investment decisions between potential wind farm developers, enabling the building of the infrastructure in the most efficient manner. Efficient investment can reduce the risk of both network constraint and excessive costs for developers and ultimately energy consumers. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is looking at the optimal location of energy infrastructure as part of its Integrated System Plan.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In relatively higher-cost areas, wind technologies can become more cost competitive if there is sufficiently high demand and/or co-generation projects are feasible. For example, northern Queensland resources may become more attractive for developers in coming years given relatively higher growth in energy demand and the potential to co-locate with good solar resources. Analysis by the Australian National University suggests that, in a 100 per cent renewables scenario, developing northern Queensland wind resources together with high-voltage direct-current transmission could reduce the overall cost of meeting Australia’s electricity needs by $2 per megawatt hour (MWh), assuming a $50/MWh levelised cost of electricity for wind and solar photovoltaics (Stocks 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Cost competitiveness will also flow from technological improvements in rotor design, tower height, configuration and wind-sensing equipment, and increasing blade size relative to generator size. However, these efficiency gains are expected to be smaller than the cost reductions coming from reductions in build costs. The latter are expected to be derived from economies of scale as the construction of wind turbines increases. These cost reductions will largely depend on the outlook for commodity and raw materials prices, labour costs and manufacturing costs. </p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As a proven and mature technology, wind power has no significant remaining technological challenges. One of the key remaining issues is enabling wind turbines to provide frequency regulation services for the electricity grid. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency is supporting a project to test this capability at the Hornsdale Wind Farm in South Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Integrating wind energy into the electricity system requires management of both resource variability and its nonsynchronous nature. Variation in wind energy availability can be caused by broad weather patterns and seasonal factors, depending on location. Wind can be predicted with reasonable confidence at least 12 hours in advance; but the duration and degree of confidence in the prediction depends on local topography. <u><a href=\"#id.4a2ngvyk7lk\" >Figure 8</a></u> illustrates the variability of wind energy generation across the day in South Australia.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The operation of an electricity system with high levels of wind energy would need to differ from current practice, using energy storage and demand management to align supply with demand. Daily and annual variations in wind generation can be managed through some combination of geographic diversity, complementing wind use with other types of generation, greater storage capacity, demand management, and systematic solutions at local and grid scales (e.g. storage on multiple scales). For example, greater use of pumped hydro sites could allow storage of wind energy for use during peak demand.</p><h3 >Other challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Building trust early in the development process is crucial to ensuring community support for energy infrastructure projects and wind farms are no exception. Some communities affected by proposed wind farms have expressed concerns that low-frequency noise emitted by wind turbines can cause illness in those living in close proximity. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In October 2015, the Australian Government appointed a National Wind Farm Commissioner to respond to community concerns about wind farms. The Commissioner receives and refers complaints from concerned community residents about wind farms, and promotes best practices for industry and government in the planning and operation of wind farms. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Australian Government also established the Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines in 2015. This committee builds on the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), to provide advice on the science and monitoring of potential impacts of wind turbine sound on health and the environment. The NHMRC has previously found no direct link between exposure to wind farm noise and damage to human health (NHMRC 2015).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has a detailed approval process for wind farm developments, and compliance is required with relevant state and territory environmental protection agency guidelines and regulations. Following the right protocols, and incorporating the values of trust, transparency and participation can help create more authentic relationships with local stakeholders, to gain acceptance or approval for development.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Understanding how to manage the above challenges will be critical for future investment decisions for both network providers and the renewable energy sector, especially wind.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian Energy Market Operator. 2015.

Although solar energy is a variable resource, when coupled with storage technologies, it can provide reliable, dispatchable electricity to meet peak demand and balance the electricity system. Solar energy can also complement the daily profile of other variable renewable energy sources, such as wind, providing its maximum output when wind generation is lower (Prasad et al. 2017).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"  id=\"id.yrrs95h54co5\"><p >Table 1 Solar resource as applicable to various technologies</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Technology</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Energy type</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Photovoltaic</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar hot water</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Heat</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Concentrated photovoltaic</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Concentrated solar thermal</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Heat and electricity</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Chemically stored energy</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" ><p >Source: Australian Renewable Energy Agency</p></td></tr></table><br /><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The modular nature of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, government incentives and Australia’s excellent solar resource have resulted in the widespread uptake of solar energy systems, particularly at the residential scale. Most deployments to date in Australia have been residential solar PV systems for electricity generation and residential solar hot water systems (some of which are also used for space heating and cooling). Significant deployment is also occurring to provide remote off-grid power, particularly at mine sites and surrounding communities, thereby reducing exposure to high or uncertain diesel prices and the need to transport diesel large distances. Continued reductions in the cost of solar PV systems, particularly large-scale solar with associated electricity or thermal storage, are expected to further drive uptake of solar energy and contribute to it playing a greater role in Australia’s energy mix. The deployment of concentrated solar thermal systems and solar PV systems for large-scale electricity generation, and the infrastructure to transform solar energy into chemically stored alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen fuel or ammonia are still at early stages of development in Australia. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface can be separated into different components, which add up to the global irradiance: beam or direct, diffuse, and reflected irradiance. Direct (or beam) irradiance is the sunlight that travels in a straight line from the sun to the surface on which it falls. Diffuse irradiance is the sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere by clouds, humidity and other particles, and appears to come from the whole sky area. Reflected irradiance is the irradiance that is reflected from the Earth’s surfaces, which generally has limited impact on solar generation, except in areas close to water bodies, deserts or snow. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">For a surface that is not horizontal, such as most photovoltaic and solar thermal systems, the irradiance is received in the plane of the array. The global plane of the array irradiance is the sum of the beam, diffuse and reflected irradiance. Direct normal irradiance (DNI) is the direct irradiance that is captured by a surface that tracks the position of the sun throughout the day. Concentrating solar thermal and some photovoltaic systems use tracking to maximise the amount of DNI captured, often at the expense of the diffuse and reflected irradiance. These systems are higher cost but the energy generated is more valuable. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">For solar resource assessments, the annual global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and the annual DNI are useful metrics when deciding where to locate a solar project, and which technology to use (<u><a href=\"#id.aovdnp8fqyum\" >Figure 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.82eoaqq0g4sh\" >Figure 2</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.aovdnp8fqyum\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided. Please email Geoscience Australia at clientservices@ga.gov.au for an alternate description.\" title=\"Average annual solar resource across Australia, based on global horizontal irradiance\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/ga-aera/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_200/v1/figures/AERA_10_02.jpg\"/></p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"></p><h2 >Australia’s resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has, on average, the world’s highest solar irradiation, receiving up to 35 megajoules per square metre per day (MJ/m<sup>2</sup>/day) or 9.7 kilowatt hours per square metre per day (kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day). Australia receives an average of 58 million petajoules (PJ) of solar radiation per year (Geoscience Australia and BREE 2014). Theoretically, if only 0.1 per cent of the incoming energy could be converted into usable energy at an efficiency of 10 per cent, all of Australia’s energy needs could be supplied by solar energy. Similarly, the energy falling on a solar farm covering 50 km by 50 km would be sufficient to meet all of Australia’s electricity needs (W. Stein, pers. comm. 2009). With today’s panel efficiency around 20 per cent and continuing to improve, the space required to meet energy needs from solar continues to decrease. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The amount of solar energy reaching Australia changes throughout the year due to seasonal and climatic variances. Cloud cover is determined by local weather conditions and seasonal patterns. These can be irregular between years, and present a challenge to identifying suitable sites for solar energy facilities. The position of the sun in the sky is also variable, but predictable, changing during the course of a day and throughout the year. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar exposure maps (e.g. <u><a href=\"#id.aovdnp8fqyum\" >Figure 1</a></u> and <u><a href=\"#id.82eoaqq0g4sh\" >Figure 2</a></u>) show higher solar exposure across central and northern Australia, and lower solar exposure in coastal areas in the south. Areas of inland Australia generally have lower moisture content in the air and therefore less cloud cover. This reduced cloudiness directly influences the amount of solar exposure at the surface and hence the quality of the solar resource. Coastal areas, especially in the south, have higher atmospheric moisture content, leading to greater and more frequent cloud cover and therefore lower solar exposure. Solar exposure also varies seasonally, with reduced solar exposure in the north during the tropical monsoon.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Earth travels around the sun in an elliptical path; the Earth is closer to the sun (called perihelion) during the Southern Hemisphere’s summer, which is why Australia’s summers are hotter than Europe’s. The Earth also has an axial tilt, which means that in Australia the sun is more directly overhead during the summer than in winter. The considerable difference in solar irradiance between summer and winter can be an issue in load balancing for solar plants feeding into the electricity grid.</p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar is the most abundant energy resource on Earth and can potentially be used in most regions of the world. The theoretical potential, which is the amount of irradiance at the Earth’s surface, has been estimated at 3.9 million exajoules (EJ) per year (Geoscience Australia and BREE 2014). In general, latitudes closer to the equator receive higher GHI (<u><a href=\"#id.xp6zsmarryua\" >Figure 3</a></u>). However, seasonal factors such as cloud cover mean that tropical regions have a lower annual GHI than desert regions further from the equator. Although both GHI and DNI (<u><a href=\"#id.td7scqim2uab\" >Figure 4</a></u>) are affected by cloud cover, the effect on the latter is more pronounced. The highest solar resource potential is in north Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East (Geoscience Australia and BREE 2014).</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar has been the fastest-growing technology in the renewable energy sector in Australia during the past ten years. At the end of 2017, Australia had 2.8 million solar energy installations, with small-scale solar PV systems accounting for over 60 per cent of these. As at 31 December 2017, rooftop solar PV systems were installed in over 20 per cent of Australian households, and small-scale solar hot water heaters were installed in over 10 per cent of Australian households. In some locations, the percentage of households with rooftop solar PV systems is already over 40 per cent (Australian Photovoltaic Institute 2018)</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s annual solar installations grew rapidly from 2007, initially driven by solar thermal installations for domestic water heating. Since 2010, the majority of installations have been residential rooftop solar PV systems, driven by significant reductions in costs of solar PV panels and also supportive government policies such as feed-in tariffs. The growth rate in installations, particularly for solar hot water, has slowed since 2011 as many of these policies have been wound back and the installed base has grown. As highlighted in <u><a href=\"#id.dl2l2ui9yl0u\" >Figure 5</a></u>, 227 248 solar installations occurred nationally in 2017, with photovoltaics accounting for almost 75 per cent of these.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2017, 1057 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity from systems up to 100 kW in capacity was added nationally, bringing Australia’s total small-scale solar PV capacity to approximately 6.3 gigawatts (GW). When projects in the 100 kW to 1 MW capacity range are added, the total is over 7  GW. The leading states for total installed systems with capacity &#60;100 kW, are Queensland at 1.9 GW, followed by New South Wales (1.4 GW) and Victoria (1.2 GW; <u><a href=\"#id.3uwnrh5wl7cg\" >Figure 6</a></u>). In most locations it is now cheaper to get electricity from the roof than from the grid for most reasonable payback periods (Australian Energy Council 2016, Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2017).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As at 31 December 2017, Australia had over 300 MW of large-scale solar capacity registered in the National Electricity Market, with a further 300 MW of capacity from plants larger than 100 kW (Australian Photovoltaic Institute 2018;  <u><a href=\"#id.t1mmv3a04sml\" >Figure 7</a></u>). Following rapid reductions in solar costs, investment has surged with over 2 GW of solar large scale capacity under construction during 2018 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2018)</p><br /><h2 >Production and consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia does not export or import any electricity; hence, Australia’s production and consumption of solar energy are equal.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation from solar energy in Australia is currently largely from photovoltaic installations, primarily small rooftop systems. Generation from large-scale solar PV and concentrated solar thermal is increasing but remains a small contributor to total electricity generation.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity generation from solar energy has increased rapidly in recent years, albeit from a low base (<u><a href=\"#id.py3kro3lpb5q\" >Figure 8</a></u>). From 2008–09 to 2014–15, electricity generation from solar grew at an average rate of 76.2 per cent per year, from 0.2 terawatt hours (TWh) to 6 TWh. Despite recent increases in solar generation, it remains a small contributor to Australia’s total generation, at 2.4 per cent in 2014–15. In 2014–15, Queensland generated the largest amount of electricity from solar nationally, but South Australia had the highest reliance on solar generation, at 6.5 per cent of the electricity mix (<u><a href=\"#id.888i2uwst61p\" >Figure 9</a></u>). These trends are expected to continue over the new few years.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia’s primary energy consumption of solar energy was 36.3 PJ in 2014–15, which accounted for 0.6 per cent of primary energy consumption and 10.6 per cent of all renewable energy use. Consumption of solar energy in Australia grew at an average annual rate of 24.2 per cent from 2006–07 to 2014–15. The bulk of growth during this period was initially from solar thermal systems used for domestic water heating, followed by solar PV (<u><a href=\"#id.l8ts29g6fyon\" >Figure 10</a></u>). The combination of increasingly inexpensive solar technologies and various feed-in tariffs and rebate schemes has made solar technologies more accessible to households as rising energy bills have encouraged the uptake of alternative sources of supply. The combination of increasing system size and higher take up rates during 2018 indicates energy produced and consumed from solar will grow significantly in coming years.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, New South Wales had the highest solar hot water energy consumption in Australia at 4 PJ, while Queensland had the highest solar PV consumption at 6.9 PJ. From 2009–10 to 2014–15, Queensland had the highest growth rate of solar use (35.5 per cent per year), followed by South Australia (34.1 per cent per year) and Tasmania (28.5 per cent per year; <u><a href=\"#id.6ucj0znh6nly\" >Figure 11</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia compares favourably with other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the world in terms of solar energy’s share of total generation, as well as in the annual growth rate as a proportion of primary energy consumption (<u><a href=\"#id.mcgew8nv8y67\" >Table 2</a></u>). </p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"7\"  id=\"id.mcgew8nv8y67\"><p >Table 2 Key solar energy statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Unit</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia 2014–15<sup>a</sup></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2014</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">World 2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Primary energy consumption</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">36</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">36</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1034</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">935</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1998</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.61</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.23</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.6</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.54</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.35</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">CAGR from 2000</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">18.78</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">16.67</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">13.04</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">13.13</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">17.12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity output</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">TWh</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">6</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">6</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">183</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">155</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">198</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.36</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">2.46</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.70</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.44</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.83</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">CAGR from 2000</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">38.83</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">40.32</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">39.43</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">41.12</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">41.36</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity capacity</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">GW</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">137</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"7\" ><p >a.

Future retail electricity prices will also be an important factor for rooftop photovoltaic installation, particularly by businesses.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar PV technologies are at different stages of RD&#38;D and commercialisation. Whereas commercial-scale solar PV, rooftop solar PV and direct-use solar water heaters are considered mature technologies thermal electricity generation technologies require further investment in RD&#38;D. There is also substantial PV RD&#38;D underway which will further reduce costs and increase module efficiency. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Across all solar PV technologies, the outlook depends on the future cost of solar energy relative to other energy resources, including mechanisms to deal with variability and the time-of-day value of energy that solar PV produces.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Because they are at earlier stages of development, the outlook for investment in commercial-scale concentrated solar PV and thermal electricity generation depends on demonstration at commercial scale. Infrastructure to transform solar energy from these large-scale solar plants into chemically stored alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen fuel or ammonia is still at the early stages of development in Australia. Continued investment in RD&#38;D over time is required to produce a body of evidence that will reduce risks and encourage deployment of these technologies.</p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Australian, state and territory governments are playing supporting roles in transitioning Australia to a lower carbon emissions economy through initiatives such as the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and ARENA, which provide support for RD&#38;D. Experience gained through deployment will help reduce costs further (particularly for Australia-specific aspects of the supply chain, such as installation and financing). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the CEFC launched a large-scale competitive round for solar PV projects in 2016 to capitalise on global cost reductions and reduce Australia-specific costs. Following the round, large-scale photovoltaic electricity generation has reached commercially competitive costs with wind energy generation (ARENA 2017). The costs of large-scale photovoltaic systems are expected to fall as economies of scale reduce supply chain costs, and experience with construction, installation and maintenance increases.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Reductions in the costs for rooftop solar PV systems have increased the uptake by Australian households and commercial-scale users, a trend that is expected to continue (Australian Energy Market Operator 2016). In addition to declining costs, the competitiveness of commercial-scale solar energy will also depend on government policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which tend to make renewable energy sources more cost competitive. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Solar thermal generation has a higher cost than solar PV on a levelised cost of electricity basis, but has the advantage of a low marginal cost for thermal storage, providing a higher relative value and thus the potential for solar thermal generation to be a dispatchable source of electricity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Investors in all large-scale solar projects need to balance the need to maximise solar radiation with the need to minimise the costs of connecting to the electricity grid. Large up-front investment to build long-distance transmission lines will continue to be required to facilitate large-scale solar projects in the future. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">As renewable energy penetration increases, the ability of solar to compete with other technologies will become more difficult due to variability in output. The use of storage systems can make solar technology comparable with dispatchable technologies, but will affect the cost competitiveness of standalone solar projects. </p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The future development prospects for solar energy will largely depend on the cost of solar technologies and the value of the energy produced, taking into account variability of the resource and its time of production relative to other energy sources. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Challenges for solar development include managing the variable nature of the resource and ensuring its effective integration into the grid. Some of the issues needing to be addressed to ensure effective integration are the variable nature of the resource, the location of solar PV generation capacity in electricity distribution networks rather than connected to transmission (i.e. solar rooftop PV generating at the site of consumption, rather than attached to main transmission lines), and the potential for fast changes to the frequency of the grid if sudden changes in generation. Having fewer conventional plants with spinning machines is also a challenge to maintain system strength. Flexible capacity systems such as batteries which can provide fast frequency response can help. Variation in solar energy availability is related to diurnal variation between day and night but can also be affected by passing clouds (causing short-term variations), broader weather patterns and seasonal factors, depending on location (<u><a href=\"#id.9ndipn84rtui\" >Figure 12</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Cost reductions in battery storage could in future contribute to increasing the uptake of solar energy as consumers are able to store excess energy during the day for use during peak periods. Solar energy can also be used to complement the daily profile of other variable renewable energy sources, such as wind, providing maximum output when wind generation is lower. This would open the door to large-scale co-generation projects to manage variability issues, with less reliance on storage capacity.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australian Energy Council. 2016.

Thus, the wave energy resource is largest in oceans subjected to strong, steady winds where a sufficient ‘fetch’ exists that enables such waves to form over time and distance. Winds are created by differences in the temperature of the air, essentially driven by variations in the sun’s heat between the tropics and the poles. Ocean-current energy is also due to the action of the winds, modified by the Earth’s rotation. Ocean thermal energy is more directly due to solar heating of the sea surface; the sun heating the sea surface results in a temperature difference between the surface and the deep ocean. All these forms of ocean renewable energy are thus derived ultimately from the sun’s heat. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In contrast, tidal energy is due to the movement of celestial bodies, mostly the moon, and varies geographically with the size and shape of continents and bays, and the topography of the sea floor and inlets. Salinity gradient energy is derived from the difference in salt concentration between seawater and fresh water.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Ocean energy is harnessed by converting the various forms of energy into electricity using a variety of technologies. Tides contain both potential energy, related to vertical fluctuations in sea level, and kinetic energy, related to the horizontal motion of the water column. This energy can currently be harnessed using two mature technologies: tidal barrages and tidal stream generators. Wave energy is generated by converting the energy of ocean waves (swells) into other forms of energy (currently only electricity) using a variety of technologies, several of which are currently being trialled to find the most efficient. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The most advanced method of salinity gradient energy is called ‘pressure-retarded osmosis’, which is a means of converting the salinity differences between freshwater and saltwater into useful energy. This and other salinity gradient technologies are in very early stages of development.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In ocean thermal energy, the temperature difference between the surface of the ocean and the deep ocean is converted to electricity. Although this technology was first proposed more than a century ago, numerous technical challenges have so far precluded commercialisation.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Ocean energy is at the demonstration stage in Australia. Resource characterisation of wave and tidal energy is currently the key priority for the developing sector. Tidal energy devices in operation and test deployment around the world are generally more technically and commercially advanced than wave energy, with many system components and skill sets directly transferable from the wind energy and hydroelectricity sectors. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.rausj82chv10\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

The total wave energy on the entire Australian continental shelf at any one time, on average, is approximately 3.13 petajoules (PJ; Hemer et al. 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The wave resource is sometimes represented by the energy flux per metre of wave crest width, although the energy available will vary at different depths along an imaginary line drawn from the coast to the location where the resource is accessed. Using the data shown in <u><a href=\"#id.rausj82chv10\" >Figure 1</a></u> to estimate how much wave energy is present at a given depth, Hemer et al. (2017) estimated the total annual integrated wave energy flux at the 25 m, 50 m and 200 m depth contours to be 1796, 2653 and 2732 terawatt hours per year (TWh/year), respectively. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The largest resource is available in the southern coastal region, with 1455 TWh/year estimated at the 25 m depth contour from 29°S on the Western Australian coast to 148°E on the southern tip of Tasmania, including western Victoria (Hemer et al. 2017).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Wave variability is also an important consideration for wave energy extraction. At the 25 m isobath (the depth around which many wave devices are currently being tested), much of the southern mid-latitude coastal region is also favourable as it has relatively low variability in wave energy with respect to the total available wave energy. This contrasts with the tropical north, where the lower available wave resource is characterised by a larger ratio of large waves to mean wave height as a result of the occurrence of tropical cyclones interspersed with frequent and extended periods of minimal wave energy (Hemer et al. 2017). </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">While accurate large-scale assessments of tidal energy are not yet available for Australia, these resources can be provisionally evaluated using the tidal energy flux, as a measure of the flow through a channel (<u><a href=\"#id.x0q5ev360ye5\" >Figure 2</a></u>). World-class tidal energy resources have been identified in King Sound (Western Australia) and Banks Strait (Tasmania). Estimates of a hypothetical tidal barrage system at King Sound reveal capacity of 8 TWh/year, whereas a tidal stream system at Banks Strait may produce only 0.13 TWh/year (CSIRO 2012).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Limited thermal, current and salinity gradient resources exist in viable proximity to the national grid.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><img id=\"id.x0q5ev360ye5\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

In general, wave and ocean thermal resources are larger and more geographically distributed globally than tidal resources.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The worldwide theoretical potential of wave energy has been calculated as 29 500 TWh/year, but it is heterogeneous and geographically distributed. The worldwide theoretical power of tidal energy, including tidal currents, has been estimated at approximately 1200 TWh/year, and ocean thermal energy conversion has been conservatively estimated at 44 000 TWh/year. This ocean thermal potential is concentrated around the tropics in areas where ocean depths exceed 1000 m. The worldwide theoretical potential for salinity gradient energy has been estimated at 1650 TWh/year, primarily at the mouths of major rivers, where large volumes of fresh water flow out to sea. (Ocean Energy Systems 2017).</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">To date, all ocean energy projects in Australia have been small pilot projects. The International Energy Agency reports that Australia’s installed ocean energy capacity has been 1 MW since 2007; data are currently available up to 2014 (International Energy Agency 2016a). This apparent consistency reflects a thin patchwork of wave and tidal stream pilot generation projects, most of which were usually in operation for less than 12 months. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Carnegie Clean Energy’s Perth Wave Energy Project was Australia’s first commercial wave energy pilot. It supplied both electricity and desalinated water to the HMAS Stirling naval base on Garden Island in Western Australia. Carnegie reported that three 240 kilowatt units produced for a cumulative total of approximately 14 000 hours (Carnegie Clean Energy 2018a, b).</p><h2 >Production and consumption</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There is currently no trade in ocean energy due to logistical barriers.; thus, Australia’s production and consumption of ocean energy are equal. Given the infrastructure barriers to connecting ocean energy to existing electricity networks, consumption often occurs near where the energy is produced.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although small-scale pilot projects have operated in recent years, and despite the International Energy Agency’s recording 1 MW of installed capacity (International Energy Agency 2016a), no ocean energy projects were actively generating in Australia as at March 2018. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Ocean energy accounts for only a small fraction of energy generation in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; 0.002 per cent in 2015), and for an even smaller fraction of world generation (0.0006 per cent in 2014; <u><a href=\"#id.bblu1jgisnun\" >Table 1</a></u>). Very little ocean energy is generated in non-OECD nations. The low levels of ocean energy generation reflect its status as an emerging technology. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Since 2000, ocean energy generation in the OECD has grown by 92 per cent. However, growth has not been consistent during this period. Ocean energy generation showed little change from 2000 to 2012. Generation during this period was largely attributable to the La Rance tidal barrage in France, commissioned in 1966. In 2013, ocean generation in the OECD almost doubled as a result of the introduction of the Sihwa Lake tidal barrage power station in the Republic of Korea. There has been continued growth in ocean energy generation in the OECD since 2013.</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"6\"  id=\"id.bblu1jgisnun\"><p >Table 1 Key ocean energy statistics</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Unit</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia<sup> </sup>2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2015</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">OECD 2014</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">World 2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Primary energy consumption</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">PJ</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.002</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.002</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.001</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">CAGR from 2000</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.43</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.44</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">4.41</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity output</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">TWh</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.03</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.99</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">1.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Share of total</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">%</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.01</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.01</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.00</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Electricity capacity</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">GW</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.001</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">0.52</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">na</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\" ><p >na = not available; CAGR = compound annual growth rate; OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; GW = gigawatt; PJ = petajoule; TWh = terawatt hour</p><p >Sources: International Energy Agency (2015; 2016a, b); Department of Industry Innovation and Science (2016)</p></td></tr></table><br /><h2 >Investment</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In Australia, two wave energy demonstration plants are currently under construction (<u><a href=\"#id.dgd18avbebe4\" >Table 2</a></u>).

Thus, the future development and use of Australia’s ocean energy will largely depend on its cost competitiveness and how its integration into the energy grid is managed.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Significant challenges to deployment, particularly for wave and other offshore infrastructure, are survivability at sea; the fact that designs are yet to converge (particularly for wave technologies), which will allow a global supply chain to develop; and a lack of risk capital to finance demonstration. In addition, the poorly characterised Australian ocean energy resource is slowing the sector’s development. This is progressively being addressed by studies such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)–funded national tidal mapping study, led by the Australian Maritime College, the University of Tasmania and CSIRO. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Although developments are under way in many countries, efforts to advance ocean energy technologies are currently concentrated in the United Kingdom (particularly Scotland), New England (United States) and Nova Scotia (Canada). Domestically, ARENA has co-funded research and demonstration projects with private industry. Given the high cost of ocean energy relative to other sources, the pace of future investment will depend on the ability to capture benefits beyond simply on-grid electricity. This could include displacing diesel costs in off-grid locations, or reducing the need for energy storage (by providing predictable energy supply) to provide dispatchable electricity from other renewable sources.</p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Despite Australia’s extensive wave and tidal energy resources, the very low level of ocean energy generation reflects the immaturity of the current technologies. It is expected that ocean energy will remain a relatively high-cost option compared with other energy resources in the medium term. The future use and potential for cost reduction of ocean energy are highly dependent on the resources devoted to research, development and demonstration (RD&#38;D) – in particular, focusing on improving energy conversion technologies and finding appropriate sites that can deliver energy to the grid at an economically viable cost.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Selecting an appropriate site for ocean energy is an important step in commercialisation of a project. Proximity to existing transmission lines is particularly important for ‘first mover’ projects in a region, which may have to pay a substantial premium for transmission infrastructure to be built to take electricity to the wholesale market. Access to other infrastructure such as ports, roads and rail is another important factor to consider to ensure that equipment can be transported to the project site efficiently and economically. However, proximity to maritime shipping zones, fishing reserves, and environmentally sensitive or recreational areas may mean that certain sites cannot be used.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Ocean energy technology is most likely to be commercially viable for islands that currently ship in non-renewable fuels to generate energy (at high cost), and for remote coastal communities that are either not grid connected or are at the fringes of the electricity grid, such that wave generation may be competitive with the maintenance of long-distance electricity grid transmission.</p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A key challenge for wave energy (and potentially for ocean thermal energy conversion) is striking a balance between robust design, cost and energy performance. Placing devices in higher-energy environments increases the risk of damage and makes maintenance more difficult, increasing cost and reducing efficiency. Ultimately, the most prospective sites may be those that allow more continuous generation rather than exploit the most energetic resource. Most wave and tidal technologies use a number of devices arranged in an array, which can create localised effects on the water. Understanding the best way to arrange devices in an array is important to maximise output. ARENA is currently funding research to optimise wave arrays. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The pace at which technology-specific challenges to integration can be overcome, cost competitiveness can be improved and acceptable levels of impact on the marine environment can be demonstrated depends on the resources dedicated to RD&#38;D. With the possible exception of tidal barrages, ocean energy conversion technologies have yet to converge on a single optimal technology for energy conversion. Ocean energy technological innovation is occurring both in Australia and overseas. Technological advances overseas will spill over and influence any future Australian ocean energy industry. For this reason, the resources directed at RD&#38;D both domestically and internationally will be critical in determining the pace at which the commercial viability of ocean energy improves.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Challenges for ocean energy development include ensuring smooth integration into the grid, and understanding how best to integrate ocean energy sources such as wave and tidal power with other renewable energy and storage technologies to match energy demand. Variation in ocean energy availability can be caused by daily variation between high and low tides, and broader weather patterns and seasonal conditions. Local topography can also affect the wave resource close to shore. However, tidal energy is predictable over all time-scales, and wave energy can be forecast with reasonable confidence over a period approximately three times longer than wind (around 36 hours) and provides a potential alternative to wind energy, offering greater predictability and using less space to capture energy.</p><h2 >References</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">BPS. 2018.

Depending on the feedstock, the resource is measured in either dry metric tonnes or wet metric tonnes. A range of conversion pathways can be used for different types of feedstock (<u><a href=\"#id.nxlw418phqee\" >Table 1</a></u>).

Ethanol can be used straight or blended with petroleum fuels – for example, as E10. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The technologies behind biofuels have evolved such that three generations of biofuels are recognised. Simply, first-generation biofuels are those made from feedstocks that can also be consumed as human food. These feedstocks include corn, sugarcane, sugar beet, wheat and sorghum. The fuels produced include biodiesel (vegetable oils from seeds), ethanol (fermentation of sugar or starch) and biogas (fermentation of waste). Being derived from food-related feedstocks, first-generation biofuels raised concerns about competition between food and fuel.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Second-generation biofuels are produced from feedstocks that are not normally used for human consumption. These feedstocks cover a wider range of biomass resources, from agriculture to forestry and waste materials. They require additional, advanced conversion processes, the most common of which is called lignocellulosic processing. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The third-generation of biofuels are based on improvements in the production of biomass and are derived from specialised energy crops (including algae). Algae can produce fuels such as petrol, biodiesel, butanol, ethanol and avgas, and are capable of producing much more fuel than other feedstocks. They can also consume concentrated carbon dioxide streams, and so could be used to sequester or reuse fossil fuel power plant emissions. However, algae require large amounts of fertiliser to grow; currently, this negates the economic and environmental potential of algae for fuel generation.</p><h2 >Australia’s resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia is estimated to have more than 75 million tonnes (Mt) of biomass residues and waste material available per year to produce heat, electricity and/or biofuels (J. Bird, Australian Renewable Energy Agency, pers. comm., 2016). An Australian Biomass for Bioenergy Assessment project, funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), is currently underway that will quantify more accurately the volume and type of biomass materials available by the end of 2018.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The <u><a href=\"http://biomassproducer.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Biomass Producer website</a></u>, created by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, and now hosted by Bioenergy Australia, provides an interim guide on prospects for supply of biomass in Australia and indications of possible resources for bioenergy use.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The majority of Australia’s current bioenergy production is sourced from sugarcane residues (bagasse) and wood waste. Biogas, biodiesel and ethanol transport fuels make up the remainder of the current market. Commercialisation of second-generation technologies will open up a range of new feedstocks from non-edible biomass that is not currently used (e.g. woody parts of plants, green waste, agricultural residues, algae, weed crops, sewage sludge), for biofuels and electricity generation. These feedstocks do not compete with food production and can make use of abundant waste materials, potentially providing environmental benefits. Resource availability is highly localised – for example, bagasse is a key resource in Queensland (<u><a href=\"#id.ma1to3bcrbwu\" >Figure 1</a></u>).</p><h2 >World resources</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Worldwide, significant biomass feedstocks are available from a diverse range of sources. Biomass grown specifically to produce biofuels (such as ethanol from wheat, corn or sugar beets) makes up only a small fraction of the globally available biomass. The much larger proportion is primarily from agricultural residues, wood waste from forestry activities and, to a lesser extent, the municipal waste sector. Wood waste is already used extensively for bioenergy production in Europe, particularly Finland and Sweden (World Energy Council 2016).</p><h2 >Capacity</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia had 114 operating bioenergy plants as at November 2015, with a total installed capacity of 812 megawatts (MW; Bloomberg New Energy Finance in: Clean Energy Finance Corporation 2015) (<u><a href=\"#id.712jgdvn1t83\" >Figure 2</a></u>; <u><a href=\"#id.nmefeiilcy83\" >Table 2</a></u>). Since 2012, of the 16 projects commissioned (<u><a href=\"#kix.3e75yj9y5lvn\" >Table 3</a></u>) or in the construction or approval phase, 11 are based on use of biomass waste feedstocks, totalling 254 MW. There are also a handful of projects aiming to progress the development of second- and third-generation biofuels in Australia. Bagasse accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total installed electricity generation capacity, while approximately one-quarter used biogas from landfill and wastewater treatment for generating electricity and heat (<u><a href=\"#id.nmefeiilcy83\" >Table 2</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Australia has eight bioenergy facilities with more than 20 MW of capacity. The largest is a 68 MW co-generation facility at the Pioneer Sugar Mill in northern Queensland. However, the vast majority of the 114 plants have an installed capacity of less than 10 MW each. Four of the largest five bioenergy facilities are based on bagasse co-generation. In recent years, bioenergy capacity has grown modestly in Australia, which sees Australia lag behind total installed capacity in other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Installed bioenergy and energy from waste capacity equate to 0.9 per cent of the electricity mix in Australia, whereas the average in the OECD is 2.4 per cent; Australia has a considerable investment opportunity of A$3.5–5.0 billion to 2020 (Clean Energy Finance Corporation 2015).</p><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"  id=\"id.nmefeiilcy83\"><p >Table 2 Bioenergy electricity generation capacity in Australia, by source</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Source</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Installed capacity (MW)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Forest residues</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">124</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Landfill gas and sewage</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">209</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Bagasse and other</p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\">480</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; \"><strong>Total</strong><strong><sup>a</sup></strong></p></td><td><p style=\"margin-left:0; text-align: right;\"><strong>812</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\" ><p >a.

Since 2002–03, the share of wood and wood waste in total bioenergy consumption has gradually declined from 50 per cent to 39 per cent due to a fall in residential wood-based heating. In contrast, consumption of biogas and biofuels has been growing, although from a low base, to reach 9 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Biogas uptake has been driven by waste disposal costs, while biofuels uptake has been driven by mandates for inclusion of ethanol in a portion of petrol in New South Wales and Queensland.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, approximately 42 per cent of Australia’s bioenergy was used in the food and beverages sector, specifically within the sugar industry, which uses bagasse from its sugar production to generate electricity and heat (<u><a href=\"#id.4s8my9dypwzv\" >Figure 4</a></u>). The residential sector is the second largest bioenergy user, accounting for approximately 23 per cent of bioenergy use, predominantly wood-based heating.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In contrast to Australia’s relatively low bioenergy consumption, approximately 10 per cent of the world’s primary energy consumption came from bioenergy in 2014. The share of bioenergy in primary energy consumption is higher – approximately 22 per cent – in non-OECD countries, where traditional biomass (fuelwood, charcoal and agricultural residues) is used for domestic heating and cooking. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, Australia’s electricity generation using bioenergy was 3 terawatt hours (TWh), which accounted for 1.3 per cent of total electricity generation and 10.5 per cent of electricity generation from renewable sources (<u><a href=\"#id.79btzmtr3l9w\" >Figure 5</a></u>). Since 2010–11, bioenergy electricity generation has increased by an average of 14.5 per cent per year, following a rebound in bagasse consumption and an increase in the uptake of biogas. During the same period, bioenergy’s share of total electricity generation has grown by 72 per cent.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Queensland generates the highest amount of electricity from bioenergy nationally, accounting for 45.5 per cent of the total in 2014–15 due to the contribution of bagasse co-produced from sugar production (<u><a href=\"#id.suyfyx1is9m8\" >Figure 6</a></u>).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">In 2014–15, Australia’s biofuel production was 30.5 PJ, which is an increase of 232 per cent from 2004–05 production levels (<u><a href=\"#id.pmw76y142ax6\" >Figure 7</a></u>). In the past ten years, biofuel production has grown by an average of 13 per cent per year. In 2015, biofuel production capacity in Australia was 740 million litres (ML) per year, comprising 440 ML of ethanol and 300 ML of biodiesel. Total Australian biofuel production for 2015 was estimated at 330 ML, comprising 265 ML of ethanol and 65 ML of biodiesel (Global Agricultural Information Network 2015). Production of ethanol is stable, but biodiesel output has been more variable.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Despite solid recent growth in production and consumption of biofuel, its share of total energy consumption in the transport sector is only 0.4 per cent.

However, there is still significant potential to provide a greater source of generation, including during peak demand periods and periods of low or variable supply from other sources.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The future development of Australia’s bioenergy industry will depend on its cost competitiveness compared with other energy sources, the extent of financial support gained to commercialise new technologies and feedstocks, policies to support renewable or low emissions energy and policies and subsidies relating to the treatment of waste materials, and the sustainable use of bioenergy resources. Because bioenergy can harness and convert a wide variety of feedstocks into electricity, heat and fuel, different factors will influence its use in various bioenergy technologies in the future.</p><h3 >Cost competitiveness</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Biomass combustion becomes cost competitive when inexpensive residues or wastes are available and used on-site, such as energy produced at landfill sites, paper mills and sugar mills. The costs are relatively lower at larger scales and where co-generation of heat offers opportunities to reduce other costs. </p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Development of effective harvesting and processing methods, and improved transportation and storage will also be important factors in achieving further efficiencies and cost reductions in electricity and heat generation from biomass. The techno-economic viability of biomass depends on the moisture content of the feedstock, given that water both adds weight (for transport purposes) and can greatly affect the usable energy that can be derived from the feedstock. Optimisation of supply chain logistics is therefore necessary to accurately determine a maximum catchment distance to the point of conversion, or use of any given feedstock, after which the cost of transport (relative to energy density and value) becomes prohibitive. Emerging techniques in mobile pelletisation and torrefaction as pre-treatment strategies can improve supply chain costs and logistics dramatically, by reducing moisture, enhancing storage capacity and increasing energy density.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Once the feedstock has arrived at its point of use, it can require pre-conditioning or further drying, and the length and method of storage are also important to ensure that neither moisture nor biological breakdown of the material ultimately degrades the business case. For stationary power plants, proximity to existing transmission lines is particularly important for ‘first mover’ projects in a region that may have to pay a substantial premium for transmission infrastructure to be built to take electricity to the wholesale market. In the case of bio-refineries, access to downstream infrastructure for storage and distribution of liquid biofuel (including the ability to access existing pipeline networks) is an important consideration.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Cost competitiveness is also a significant issue for biofuels, since the production costs of first-generation biofuels in Australia are highly variable due to variations in the cost of feedstock. Current demand for, and advancement of, biofuels can be negatively affected by lower oil prices. Uncertainty about future changes in oil and feedstock prices plays a role in restricting investment in new capacity. However, the development of second-generation biofuels from non-edible feedstocks (lignocellulosic biomass) will not only increase the range of low-cost feedstocks but will increase conversion efficiencies and reduce production costs. Third-generation biofuel technologies, including hydrogen production from biomass and algae production, are still in development, with various challenges to overcome in order to reduce production costs. If these new biofuel technologies can be successfully deployed in Australia, biofuels could potentially become an important contributor to our future transport fuel mix, particularly for applications, such as aviation, in which electrification will be challenging.</p><h3 >Technological challenges</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">There is an urgent need to develop technologies that enable the conversion of biomass resources into useful energy, taking into account thermodynamic efficiency, system technology and environmental impact.</p><h3 >Investment</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Much of the opportunity in the bioenergy sector consists of small-scale operations that, to date, have found it difficult to attract institutional investors due to the lack of proven operational demonstration projects and finance experience of the technology in Australia. Early commercialisation efforts and projects have often been driven by participants outside the energy sector, such as farmers or manufacturing companies, who have lacked the technical and commercial experience to execute such projects successfully. To facilitate research, development and deployment of technologies, capital investment is required. Nationally, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (through its $100 million Australian Bioenergy Fund) are providing support to the bioenergy sector from laboratory research to large-scale technology projects, to accelerate and expand the market uptake of bioenergy technologies that are not yet widely deployed in Australia. Experience gained through deployment will help reduce costs further.</p><h3 >Sustainability and social licence to operate</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">Another key factor for the development of the bioenergy sector is the sustainable management of biomass exploitation and the avoidance of negative environmental impacts of bioenergy resource production. Challenges can include competition for land use, competition for biomass use for food and stockfeed, and potential impacts on biodiversity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">The use of land to grow crops that are then used as feedstocks for bioenergy is a potentially contentious issue that requires careful balancing of the value of using land to produce agricultural products versus energy. Currently, first-generation biofuels from energy crops are constrained by the amount of land available and the limited supply of sugar and starch by-products, animal fats and used cooking oil feedstocks. For biofuels to contribute significantly to transport fuel consumption, a large portion of arable land would have to be devoted to production of energy crops.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">First-generation biofuels from energy crops also require sustainable agricultural practices to minimise environmental impacts. In Australia, biofuel production is currently too low to affect the production of agricultural commodities. However, if consumption of first-generation biofuels rises as a result of rising transport fuel demands, the development of cost-competitive second-generation biofuels will become important. Second-generation biofuel feedstocks may be grown on less productive land and degraded agricultural land to avoid competing directly with growing food, stockfeed and fibre crops. Additionally, algae and oil mallee as feedstocks for third-generation biofuels do not have to compete for freshwater resources. Feedstocks that use either waste biomass or biomass produced using waste products are likely to be more sustainable from both an environmental and a social perspective, and enhance the social licence for bioenergy.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0; \">A range of other environmental metrics are also worthy of consideration in relation to bioenergy projects. These include water intensity, land-use change, impact of fertiliser use and runoff, and overall energy balance (typically measured as a function of energy return over energy invested). A related issue is whether bioenergy produces a net reduction in carbon emissions as compared with non-renewable energy sources such as diesel. Rigorous analysis of the life cycle emissions of bioenergy projects will help inform the role that bioenergy can play in the transition to a low carbon economy.

Reporting systems have been developed for the different resources types. Adherence to standards and common frameworks makes it possible for investors to evaluate risk and potential returns, and for governments to set policy and regulations and make decisions on infrastructure development.</p><p >Schemes currently commonly used for classifying minerals, petroleum and geothermal energy utilise two axes, one to describe geological certainty, and another to describe investment or commercial readiness. These schemes are based on the McKelvey classification published in 1972 and 1976. Each of the resource estimation and reporting schemes utilised in Australia for oil and gas, coal, thorium and uranium are discussed briefly below. A three-axis classification scheme, incorporating an economic and social viability axis, field project and feasibility axis, and geological knowledge axis, has been developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2009) but is not applied in Australia currently.</p><h2 >Petroleum resource classification</h2><p >The petroleum industry in Australia uses the  <u><a href=\"http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/Petroleum_Resources_Management_System_2007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Petroleum Resources Management System</a></u> (PRMS) for classification of oil and gas resources. The description below a summary of the PRMS and an overview published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE 2007).</p><p >Oil and gas reserves and resources are defined as volumes that will be commercially recovered in the future. Unlike the inventory of a manufacturing company, reserves are physically located in reservoirs deep underground and cannot be visually inspected or counted, but rather are estimates based on the evaluation of data that provides evidence of the amount of oil and gas present. There is no definitive answer until the end of a reservoir&#39;s producing life. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The estimation of reserves volumes is generally performed by highly-skilled individuals who use their experience and professional judgment in the calculation of those volumes.</p><p >To take into account this uncertainty, the PRMS incorporates a central framework that categorises reserves and resources according to the level of certainty associated with their recoverable volumes (horizontal axis in <u><a href=\"#id.d8252rgi2a07\" >Figure 1</a></u>), and classifies them according to the potential for reaching commercial producing status (vertical axis).</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.d8252rgi2a07\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

There is also a distinct class for unrecoverable petroleum. These classes are shown on the vertical axis of the PRMS framework.</p><p >Production is the quantity of oil and natural gas that has been recovered already (by a specified date). This is primarily output from operations that have already been produced for use by consumers. Reserves represent that part of resources which are commercially recoverable and have been justified for development, while contingent and prospective resources are less certain because some significant commercial or technical hurdle must be overcome prior to there being confidence in the eventual production of the volumes.</p><p >Contingent resources are less certain than reserves. These are resources that are potentially recoverable but not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to technological or business hurdles. For contingent resources to move into the reserves category, the key conditions, or contingencies, that prevented commercial development must be clarified and removed. As an example, all required internal and external approvals should be in place or determined to be forthcoming, including environmental and governmental approvals. There also must be evidence of firm intention by a company&#39;s management to proceed with development within a reasonable time frame (typically 5 years, though it could be longer).</p><p >Prospective resources are estimated volumes associated with undiscovered accumulations. These represent quantities of petroleum which are estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from oil and gas deposits identified on the basis of indirect evidence but which have not yet been drilled. This class represents a higher risk than contingent resources since the risk of discovery is also added. For prospective resources to become classified as contingent resources, hydrocarbons must be discovered, the accumulations must be further evaluated and an estimate of quantities that would be recoverable under appropriate development projects prepared.</p><p >Some petroleum will be classified as &#34;unrecoverable&#34; at this point in time, not being producible by any projects that the company may plan or foresee. While a portion of these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial circumstances change or technological developments occur, some of the remaining portion may never be recovered due to physical or chemical constraints in the reservoir. The volumes classified using the system represent the analysis of the day, and should be regularly reviewed and updated, as necessary, to reflect changing conditions.</p><p >A project may have recoverable quantities in several resource classes simultaneously. As barriers to development are removed, some resources may move to a higher classification. One of the primary distinctions between resources and reserves is that while resources are technically recoverable, they may not be commercially viable. Reserves are always commercially viable and there is intent to develop them.</p><h3 >Differences in categories (horizontal axis)</h3><p >Within any resource class other than production, volumes are placed into different categories based on their certainty of eventually coming out of the ground. Decisions to upgrade volumes to any category within a class are generally based on the technical certainty of recovering the volumes. In this discussion, the focus is on the reserve class, as these volumes are commonly the focus of public discussions of oil and gas company producing assets.</p><p >The highest valued category of reserves is &#34;proved&#34; reserves. Proved reserves have a reasonable certainty of being recovered, which means a high degree of confidence that the volumes will be recovered. To be clear, reserves must have all commercial aspects addressed. It is technical issues which separate proved from unproved categories.</p><p >&#34;Probable&#34; or &#34;possible&#34; reserves are lower categories of reserves, commonly combined and referred to as &#34;unproved reserves,&#34; with decreasing levels of technical certainty. Probable reserves are volumes that are defined as &#34;less likely to be recovered than proved, but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves&#34;. Possible reserves are reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are less likely to be recoverable than probable reserves.</p><p >The term 1P is frequently used to denote proved reserves, 2P is the sum of proved and probable reserves and 3P the sum of proved, probable and possible reserves. The best estimate of recovery from committed projects is generally considered to be the 2P sum of proved and probable reserves. Note that these volumes only refer to projects that are currently justified for or already in development. Total value of any resource base must include an assessment of the contingent and prospective resources as well as reserves.</p><p >In order for volumes to move from one category to the next, the technical issues which cause them to be placed in less certain categories must be resolved. In the majority of cases, this requires that additional data must be obtained before any greater certainty can be recognised. This may include, among other things, the drilling of additional wells, the monitoring of current production to better understand performance or the implementation of a pilot to have greater confidence in the volumes that full scale development projects may eventually produce.</p><h2 >Mineral resource classification</h2><p >Minerals companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange report resource information according to the  <u><a href=\"http://www.jorc.org/docs/JORC_code_2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves</a></u>, also called the &#39;JORC Code&#39; (Joint Ore Reserves Committee [JORC] 2012). The Joint Ore Reserves Committee was established in 1971 and published several reports containing recommendations on the classification and Public Reporting of Ore Reserves prior to the release of the first edition of the JORC Code in 1989. Similar to the McKelvey (1976) classification, the JORC Code utilises axes of geological uncertainty and commercial readiness (<u><a href=\"#id.oh72avs2cfl4\" >Figure 2</a></u>). The summary below paraphrases the JORC Code (2012).</p><h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"id.oh72avs2cfl4\" alt=\"Due to the complexity of this image no alternative description has been provided.

Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration.</p><p >An &#39;Indicated Mineral Resource&#39; is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Ore Reserve.</p><p >A &#39;Measured Mineral Resource&#39; is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proved Ore Reserve or under certain circumstances to a Probable Ore Reserve.</p><p >&#39;Modifying Factors&#39; are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Consideration of the confidence level of the Modifying Factors is important in conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.</p><p >An &#39;Ore Reserve&#39; is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified.</p><p >A &#39;Probable Ore Reserve&#39; is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit.</p><p >A &#39;Proved Ore Reserve&#39; is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.</p><h2 >Uranium resource classification</h2><p >Geoscience Australia prepares estimates of Australia&#39;s uranium resources within categories defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency and International Atomic Energy Agency (OECD NEA and IAEA 2016). The following is summarised from that publication.</p><p >Uranium resources are classified by a scheme (based on geological certainty and costs of production) developed to combine resource estimates from a number of different countries into harmonised global figures. Identified resources (which include Reasonably Assured Resources (RAR), and Inferred Resources) refer to uranium deposits delineated by sufficient direct measurement to conduct pre-feasibility and sometimes feasibility studies. For RAR, high confidence in estimates of grade and tonnage are generally compatible with mining decision-making standards. Inferred resources are not defined with such a high degree of confidence and generally require further direct measurement prior to making a decision to mine. Undiscovered resources (prognosticated and speculative) refer to resources that are expected to exist based on geological knowledge of previously discovered deposits and regional geological mapping.</p><p >Resource estimates are divided into separate categories reflecting different levels of confidence in the quantities reported. The resources are further separated into categories based on the cost of production.</p><p >Reasonably Assured Resources refers to uranium that occurs in known mineral deposits of delineated size, grade and configuration such that the quantities which could be recovered within the given production cost ranges with currently proven mining and processing technology, can be specified. Estimates of tonnage and grade are based on specific sample data and measurements of the deposits and on knowledge of deposit characteristics. Reasonably assured resources have a high assurance of existence. Unless otherwise noted, RAR are expressed in terms of quantities of uranium recoverable from mineable ore (see recoverable resources).</p><p >Inferred resources refers to uranium, in addition to RAR, that is inferred to occur based on direct geological evidence, in extensions of well-explored deposits, or in deposits in which geological continuity has been established but where specific data, including measurements of the deposits, and knowledge of the deposit&#39;s characteristics, are considered to be inadequate to classify the resource as RAR. Estimates of tonnage, grade and cost of further delineation and recovery are based on such sampling as is available and on knowledge of the deposit characteristics as determined in the best known parts of the deposit or in similar deposits. Less reliance can be placed on the estimates in this category than on those for RAR. Unless otherwise noted, inferred resources are expressed in terms of quantities of uranium recoverable from mineable ore.</p><h3 >Cost categories</h3><p >The OECD NEA and IAEA (2016) uses cost categories, in United States dollars (USD), defined as: &#60;USD 40/kgU, &#60;USD 80/kgU, &#60;USD 130/kgU and &#60;USD 260/kgU. All resource categories are defined in terms of costs of uranium recovered at the ore processing plant.</p><p >Reasonably Assured Resource and Inferred Resource estimates are expressed in terms of recoverable tonnes of uranium, i.e. quantities of uranium recoverable from mineable ore, as opposed to quantities contained in mineable ore, or quantities in situ, i.e. not taking into account mining and milling losses.</p><h2 >References</h2><p >Joint Ore Reserves Committee. 2012.

The International System of Units (SI) unit of energy across all energy types is the Joule (J). It is defined as the amount of work done by a force of one newton exerted over a distance of one metre.</p><p >Power is the rate at which work is delivered. The SI unit of power is the watt (W). One watt is equal to one joule per second (1 W = 1 J/sec). Watt is the common unit for electrical power (sometimes expressed as We) although may be used for thermal power (Wt).</p><p >Consumption of electric energy is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is equal to the power in kilowatts (kW) times the time period (hours (h)).</p><p >energy (kWh) = power (kW) x time (h)</p><p >The average annual energy production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/year). For example, a power plant with a capacity of one MW produces 1000 kWh when the plant runs consistently for one hour. If the power plant runs consistently with no downtime for a year (8760 hours), the generator produces 8 760 000 kWh (8760 MWh) in a year.</p><p >Both Joules and Watts are more commonly recorded in multiples.</p><table><tr><td colspan=\"2\" ><h3 >Units</h3></td></tr><tr><td><p ><strong>Abbreviation</strong></p></td><td><p ><strong>Unit of measurement</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p >GJ</p></td><td><p >Gigajoule - 10<sup>9</sup> joules</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Gt</p></td><td><p >Gigatonne - 10<sup>9</sup> tonnes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >GW</p></td><td><p >Gigawatt - 10<sup>9</sup> watts</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >kt</p></td><td><p >Kilotonne - thousand -10<sup>3</sup> tonnes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >KW</p></td><td><p >Kilowatt - thousand -10<sup>3</sup> watts</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >kWh</p></td><td><p >Kilowatt-hours - thousand -10<sup>3</sup> watt-hours</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >ML</p></td><td><p >Megalitre - million -10<sup>6</sup> litres</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >mmbbl</p></td><td><p >Million -10<sup>6</sup> barrels</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Mt</p></td><td><p >Million -10<sup>6</sup> tonnes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >MW</p></td><td><p >Megawatts - 10<sup>6</sup> watts</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >MWh</p></td><td><p >Megawatt-hours - 10<sup>6</sup> watt-hours</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >PJ</p></td><td><p >Petajoules - 10<sup>15</sup> joules</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >tcf</p></td><td><p >Trillion - 10<sup>12</sup> cubic feet</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >TJ</p></td><td><p >Terajoules - 10<sup>12</sup> joules</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >TWh</p></td><td><p >Terawatt-hours - 10<sup>12</sup> watt-hours</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"4\" ><h3 >Decimal numbering system</h3></td></tr><tr><td><p >Multiple</p></td><td><p >Scientific expression</p></td><td><p >Term</p></td><td><p >Abbreviation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Thousand</p></td><td><p >10<sup>3</sup></p></td><td><p >Kilo</p></td><td><p >k</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Million</p></td><td><p >10<sup>6</sup></p></td><td><p >Mega</p></td><td><p >M</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Billion</p></td><td><p >10<sup>9</sup></p></td><td><p >Giga</p></td><td><p >G</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Trillion</p></td><td><p >10<sup>12</sup></p></td><td><p >Tera</p></td><td><p >T</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Quadrillion</p></td><td><p >10<sup>15</sup></p></td><td><p >Peta</p></td><td><p >P</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Quintillion</p></td><td><p >10<sup>18</sup></p></td><td><p >Exa</p></td><td><p >E</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table><br /><br /><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\" ><h3 >Energy measurement</h3></td></tr><tr><td><p >Energy resource</p></td><td><p >Measure</p></td><td><p >Abbreviation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Oil and condensate</p></td><td><p >Production, reserves: Litres (usually millions or billions) or barrels (usually thousands or millions)</p></td><td><p >L, ML, GL, bbl, kbbl, mmbbl, ML, GL per day, bd, kbd, mmbd</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p >Refinery throughput/capacity: Litres (usually thousands or millions) or barrels per day (usually thousands or millions)</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p >Natural gas</p></td><td><p >Cubic feet (usually billions or trillions) or cubic metres (usually millions or billions of cubic metres)</p></td><td><p >bcf, tcf, m<sup>3</sup>, mcm, bcm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >LNG</p></td><td><p >Tonnes (usually millions)</p></td><td><p >t, Mt, Mtpa</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p >Production rate: Million tonnes per year</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p >LPG</p></td><td><p >Litres (usually megalitres) or barrels (usually millions)</p></td><td><p >L, ML, bbl, mmbl</p></td></tr><tr><td><p >Coal</p></td><td><p >Tonnes (usually millions or billions)</p></td><td><p >t U;
